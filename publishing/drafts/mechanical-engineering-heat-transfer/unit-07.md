# U07-L01 — Heat exchanger architectures and effectiveness

**Unit 7: Heat Exchangers and Integrated Thermal Systems · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** What does a heat-balance mismatch reveal about measurement or heat losses?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: A counterflow recuperator passes two streams in separate channels with heat transferred through a shared wall. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Conceptual foundations and governing relationship

**Core relationship:** `Q=ṁhot cph(Thi−Tho)=ṁcold cpc(Tco−Tci)`.

Heat exchanger performance depends on both thermal conductance and the ability of moving fluids to carry energy. The smaller heat-capacity rate limits maximum sensible heat exchange under basic two-stream assumptions. Fouling, pressure losses and control strategy change system performance after installation. Compare design points using consistent terminal conditions and state whether nominal values were measured or assumed. A high calculated effectiveness does not imply an economically or hydraulically good exchanger. The equation describes a particular kind of relation: sometimes a constitutive law, sometimes an integral energy balance, a nondimensional definition, a geometry-specific analytical solution, or a correlation validated only in an experimental range. Before using it, define each symbol and its units. State which values are measured, which are assumed, which are looked up, and which are inferred. Unlike an algebraic identity, a model may stop being valid when the shape, temperature distribution, flow regime, surface treatment or boundary conditions change. An answer that violates a conservation balance is unacceptable even if its arithmetic is flawless.

For **heat exchanger architectures and effectiveness**, sketch the physical domain and draw arrows for the relevant energy paths. A first approximation is useful when it makes the dominant mechanism visible. A more detailed approximation is useful only when an observation motivates the additional complexity. In each case, decide whether spatial temperature gradients are physically essential, whether heat is stored, and whether material properties can be treated as uniform. The goal is to preserve both insight and a traceable decision process.

## Guided numerical example: Measured hot-stream duty: Q=ṁcpΔT

**Given synthetic inputs.** Mass flow 0.2 kg/s, cp=4000 J/(kg K), hot-stream drop 15 K.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `Measured hot-stream duty: Q=ṁcpΔT` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **1.2e+04 W**. This is an illustrative arithmetic result, not a measured field or equipment rating. Preserve more precision during intermediate calculations than in the reported answer. If the output is a rate, do not confuse it with accumulated energy. If it is a temperature difference, distinguish it from absolute temperature. If it is nondimensional, the absence of units is a useful audit rather than permission to omit definitions.

**Physical interpretation.** Determine how the sign, scale and limiting cases match the original scenario. Recompute the result after raising a physically meaningful driving variable by 10%, but do not automatically assume a proportional change. The formula may contain an exponent, logarithm or regime-dependent coefficient, in which case its sensitivity varies with the operating point. Propose a second measurement that would check the prediction without merely feeding the same data into the same equation. A calibration check tests the measuring instrument, not necessarily the entire heat-transfer model.

## Derivation map and assumptions

1. Draw a control volume or differential element. Mark every mechanism that carries energy across its boundary and each mechanism that stores or generates it.
2. Choose a coordinate and sign convention, identify a characteristic length, and state whether the requested answer concerns an area, a volume, a point temperature or an integrated rate.
3. Write the governing differential or integral balance. Separate physical conservation from constitutive assumptions, geometric identities and empirical correlations.
4. Simplify only after stating the neglected processes. Common simplifications include negligible contact resistance, uniform fluid properties, quasi-steady conduction or constant wall temperature; each has a plausible failure condition.
5. Substitute values with their dimensions retained. Evaluate a limiting case: zero driving difference, vanishing thickness, extremely low coefficient, large elapsed time or another mathematically relevant limit.
6. Examine whether the dependent quantity could be independently observed and whether the observed conditions would reproduce the assumptions used in the calculation.

For this topic, For heat exchanger architectures and effectiveness, begin with both stream heat-capacity rates and an energy balance. Determine which stream is capacity-limited and whether heat losses outside the device matter. Select LMTD when terminal temperatures are known, or ε–NTU when area and inlet conditions are known but outlets are not. Keep hydraulic resistance and thermal resistance in the same design narrative. During operation, simultaneous changes in fouling, mass flow and inlet temperature can make a heat-duty decline ambiguous without additional sensor data.

## Engineering experiment and data interpretation

**Suggested investigation.** Instrument each inlet and outlet and compute duty independently on both fluid sides. Do not invent real measurements; start with an explicit hypothetical dataset or collect readings under appropriate supervision. Specify the sensor location, thermal settling criterion, and calibration state. Record environmental conditions, because an apparently small change in ambient temperature can alter both boundary gradients and material properties. Identify a control run that removes the driving source or changes only one variable. Repeat at least one operating point to estimate repeatability rather than treating an isolated reading as exact.

A defensible report includes an annotated sketch, a units table, the raw readings, a method for reducing data and a statement of what cannot be inferred. If an inverse calculation uses a model to estimate a coefficient, do not then use the very same data as independent validation. Reserve at least one different condition or instrument for a fair check. The student should be able to explain why a significant discrepancy may indicate an incorrect thermal boundary rather than a mistaken calculator operation.

## Model limits, troubleshooting and safety

**Frequent mistake:** Forcing both sides to identical measured duty without accounting for losses and uncertainty.

Diagnose the underlying reason instead of memorizing a warning. Ask what hidden assumption permits the easy formula to be written and what instrument would reveal its failure. A model may fail by incorrect dimensions, invalid regime, missing heat path, changing fluid property, an inappropriate temperature reference, or a neglected time-dependent term. Separate those failures from numerical mistakes and data-recording problems. Compare the predicted rate against any power or energy known to enter the system; a passive assembly cannot steadily deliver more energy than its stated supply without another source.

If the proposed object is a boiler, pressure vessel, battery pack, electrical appliance, medical device, industrial furnace or fire-safety system, this lesson supplies basic intuition only. Real design requires applicable codes, manufacturer data, validated correlations, abnormal-operation analysis and responsible professional review. The exploratory sliders in the companion models are not design certificates.

## Check your understanding — three problems

1. **Numerical variation.** Rework the example for a 15% increase in its driving thermal difference or equivalent controlling input. State the new units, compare changes as a percentage, and explain whether the relationship is truly linear at this point.
2. **Model selection.** Draw a different physical geometry or flow configuration where this equation might fail. Identify the precise assumption that breaks down, then propose a more suitable balance, correlation or measurement.
3. **Experimental critique.** Design a two-condition laboratory check of the guiding question. Specify a measurable dependent quantity, one plausible confounder, a calibration or repeatability step, and a criterion for recognizing a model–data disagreement.

## Extension: toward real engineering practice

Develop a small calculation sheet or script with named inputs, a units column and explicit warnings about any validity range. Test it at a nominal point and at two extremes, explaining whether the mathematics remains physically credible. Then imagine a colleague changed an input property without documenting temperature or source. Describe exactly how that would affect traceability and how you would reconstruct the decision. Finally propose one material, configuration or instrumentation change that improves thermal performance without adding unacceptable complexity or operating expense.

**Lesson conclusion.** Heat exchanger architectures and effectiveness is useful when the energy pathway, geometry, regime and measurement basis agree. Recalculate when those conditions change; do not use apparent precision to hide uncertainty. Explain the result using a physical picture, not only a number.

# U07-L02 — Log-mean temperature difference

**Unit 7: Heat Exchangers and Integrated Thermal Systems · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** Why is the arithmetic mean temperature difference usually wrong for an exchanger?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: Counterflow inlet and outlet temperature differences vary along the thermal area. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Guided numerical example: LMTD for two terminal differences

**Given synthetic inputs.** Positive terminal differences ΔT1=40 K, ΔT2=18 K.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `LMTD for two terminal differences` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **27.5514 K**.

# U07-L03 — Effectiveness–NTU analysis

**Unit 7: Heat Exchangers and Integrated Thermal Systems · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** How can a thermal duty be estimated when the outlet temperatures are unknown?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: For a specified area and stream heat capacities, ε–NTU predicts heat transfer without assumed outlet temperatures. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

# U07-L04 — Fouling and overall thermal resistance

**Unit 7: Heat Exchangers and Integrated Thermal Systems · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** Why can an exchanger lose performance after months despite unchanged pump settings?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: Mineral scale introduces extra resistance and may constrict a coolant channel. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Conceptual foundations and governing relationship

**Core relationship:** `1/U = 1/hi+Rf,i+δ/k+Rf,o+1/ho on a common-area basis`.

Heat exchanger performance depends on both thermal conductance and the ability of moving fluids to carry energy. The smaller heat-capacity rate limits maximum sensible heat exchange under basic two-stream assumptions. Fouling, pressure losses and control strategy change system performance after installation.

**Given synthetic inputs.** hi=400, ho=250 W/(m² K); wall δ=0.003 m, k=15; total fouling factor 0.0005 m²K/W.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `Common-area resistance U` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **138.8889 W/(m² K)**.

# U07-L05 — Thermal systems: heat sinks, heat pumps, and energy efficiency

**Unit 7: Heat Exchangers and Integrated Thermal Systems · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** When does reducing device temperature conflict with electrical energy use or size limits?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: An electronics sink handles 45 W under a maximum junction-to-air rise of 27 K, requiring Rθ≤0.6 K/W. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Conceptual foundations and governing relationship

**Core relationship:** `COPheating=Qhot/Win; Rθ=(Tj−Ta)/Q`.

Heat exchanger performance depends on both thermal conductance and the ability of moving fluids to carry energy. The smaller heat-capacity rate limits maximum sensible heat exchange under basic two-stream assumptions. Fouling, pressure losses and control strategy change system performance after installation. Compare design points using consistent terminal conditions and state whether nominal values were measured or assumed. A high calculated effectiveness does not imply an economically or hydraulically good exchanger. The equation describes a particular kind of relation: sometimes a constitutive law, sometimes an integral energy balance, a nondimensional definition, a geometry-specific analytical solution, or a correlation validated only in an experimental range. Before using it, define each symbol and its units. State which values are measured, which are assumed, which are looked up, and which are inferred. Unlike an algebraic identity, a model may stop being valid when the shape, temperature distribution, flow regime, surface treatment or boundary conditions change. An answer that violates a conservation balance is unacceptable even if its arithmetic is flawless.

For **thermal systems: heat sinks, heat pumps, and energy efficiency**, sketch the physical domain and draw arrows for the relevant energy paths. A first approximation is useful when it makes the dominant mechanism visible. A more detailed approximation is useful only when an observation motivates the additional complexity. In each case, decide whether spatial temperature gradients are physically essential, whether heat is stored, and whether material properties can be treated as uniform. The goal is to preserve both insight and a traceable decision process.

## Guided numerical example: Heat-sink temperature increase

**Given synthetic inputs.** Thermal power 45 W, overall junction-to-ambient resistance 0.6 K/W.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `Heat-sink temperature increase` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **27 K**. This is an illustrative arithmetic result, not a measured field or equipment rating. Preserve more precision during intermediate calculations than in the reported answer. If the output is a rate, do not confuse it with accumulated energy. If it is a temperature difference, distinguish it from absolute temperature. If it is nondimensional, the absence of units is a useful audit rather than permission to omit definitions.

**Physical interpretation.** Determine how the sign, scale and limiting cases match the original scenario. Recompute the result after raising a physically meaningful driving variable by 10%, but do not automatically assume a proportional change. The formula may contain an exponent, logarithm or regime-dependent coefficient, in which case its sensitivity varies with the operating point. Propose a second measurement that would check the prediction without merely feeding the same data into the same equation. A calibration check tests the measuring instrument, not necessarily the entire heat-transfer model.

## Derivation map and assumptions

1. Draw a control volume or differential element. Mark every mechanism that carries energy across its boundary and each mechanism that stores or generates it.
2. Choose a coordinate and sign convention, identify a characteristic length, and state whether the requested answer concerns an area, a volume, a point temperature or an integrated rate.
3. Write the governing differential or integral balance. Separate physical conservation from constitutive assumptions, geometric identities and empirical correlations.
4. Simplify only after stating the neglected processes. Common simplifications include negligible contact resistance, uniform fluid properties, quasi-steady conduction or constant wall temperature; each has a plausible failure condition.
5. Substitute values with their dimensions retained. Evaluate a limiting case: zero driving difference, vanishing thickness, extremely low coefficient, large elapsed time or another mathematically relevant limit.
6. Examine whether the dependent quantity could be independently observed and whether the observed conditions would reproduce the assumptions used in the calculation.

For this topic, For thermal systems: heat sinks, heat pumps, and energy efficiency, begin with both stream heat-capacity rates and an energy balance. Determine which stream is capacity-limited and whether heat losses outside the device matter. Select LMTD when terminal temperatures are known, or ε–NTU when area and inlet conditions are known but outlets are not. Keep hydraulic resistance and thermal resistance in the same design narrative. During operation, simultaneous changes in fouling, mass flow and inlet temperature can make a heat-duty decline ambiguous without additional sensor data.

## Engineering experiment and data interpretation

**Suggested investigation.** Compare passive sink, forced-air fan, and liquid-cooling layouts at a common heat load. Do not invent real measurements; start with an explicit hypothetical dataset or collect readings under appropriate supervision. Specify the sensor location, thermal settling criterion, and calibration state. Record environmental conditions, because an apparently small change in ambient temperature can alter both boundary gradients and material properties. Identify a control run that removes the driving source or changes only one variable. Repeat at least one operating point to estimate repeatability rather than treating an isolated reading as exact.

A defensible report includes an annotated sketch, a units table, the raw readings, a method for reducing data and a statement of what cannot be inferred. If an inverse calculation uses a model to estimate a coefficient, do not then use the very same data as independent validation. Reserve at least one different condition or instrument for a fair check. The student should be able to explain why a significant discrepancy may indicate an incorrect thermal boundary rather than a mistaken calculator operation.

## Model limits, troubleshooting and safety

**Frequent mistake:** Confusing a heat pump coefficient of performance with electrical conversion efficiency.

Diagnose the underlying reason instead of memorizing a warning. Ask what hidden assumption permits the easy formula to be written and what instrument would reveal its failure. A model may fail by incorrect dimensions, invalid regime, missing heat path, changing fluid property, an inappropriate temperature reference, or a neglected time-dependent term. Separate those failures from numerical mistakes and data-recording problems. Compare the predicted rate against any power or energy known to enter the system; a passive assembly cannot steadily deliver more energy than its stated supply without another source.

If the proposed object is a boiler, pressure vessel, battery pack, electrical appliance, medical device, industrial furnace or fire-safety system, this lesson supplies basic intuition only. Real design requires applicable codes, manufacturer data, validated correlations, abnormal-operation analysis and responsible professional review. The exploratory sliders in the companion models are not design certificates.

## Check your understanding — three problems

1. **Numerical variation.** Rework the example for a 15% increase in its driving thermal difference or equivalent controlling input. State the new units, compare changes as a percentage, and explain whether the relationship is truly linear at this point.
2. **Model selection.** Draw a different physical geometry or flow configuration where this equation might fail. Identify the precise assumption that breaks down, then propose a more suitable balance, correlation or measurement.
3. **Experimental critique.** Design a two-condition laboratory check of the guiding question. Specify a measurable dependent quantity, one plausible confounder, a calibration or repeatability step, and a criterion for recognizing a model–data disagreement.

## Extension: toward real engineering practice

Develop a small calculation sheet or script with named inputs, a units column and explicit warnings about any validity range. Test it at a nominal point and at two extremes, explaining whether the mathematics remains physically credible. Then imagine a colleague changed an input property without documenting temperature or source. Describe exactly how that would affect traceability and how you would reconstruct the decision. Finally propose one material, configuration or instrumentation change that improves thermal performance without adding unacceptable complexity or operating expense.

**Lesson conclusion.** Thermal systems: heat sinks, heat pumps, and energy efficiency is useful when the energy pathway, geometry, regime and measurement basis agree. Recalculate when those conditions change; do not use apparent precision to hide uncertainty. Explain the result using a physical picture, not only a number.
