**Unit 2: Steady Conduction and Thermal Resistance · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** How much insulation must be added to a refrigerated room wall?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: A 0.08 m layer with k=0.04 W/(m K), area 2 m² and 25 K difference carries 25 W. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Conceptual foundations and governing relationship

**Core relationship:** `Q=kA(Th−Tc)/L`.

A resistance network assumes an adequately one-dimensional heat path or a justified node approximation. The sum of temperature drops around a series path must equal the imposed difference. Parallel branches share terminal temperatures but carry different duties. Geometry changes the resistance: a flat slab has nearly constant area, whereas a pipe has growing cylindrical area. Contact resistance and convection can outweigh the material core. A finite contact area, thermal bridge or imperfect interface changes the answer in ways that cannot be corrected merely by adding more significant digits. The equation describes a particular kind of relation: sometimes a constitutive law, sometimes an integral energy balance, a nondimensional definition, a geometry-specific analytical solution, or a correlation validated only in an experimental range. Before using it, define each symbol and its units. State which values are measured, which are assumed, which are looked up, and which are inferred. Unlike an algebraic identity, a model may stop being valid when the shape, temperature distribution, flow regime, surface treatment or boundary conditions change. An answer that violates a conservation balance is unacceptable even if its arithmetic is flawless.

For **fourier law through a plane wall**, sketch the physical domain and draw arrows for the relevant energy paths. A first approximation is useful when it makes the dominant mechanism visible. A more detailed approximation is useful only when an observation motivates the additional complexity. In each case, decide whether spatial temperature gradients are physically essential, whether heat is stored, and whether material properties can be treated as uniform. The goal is to preserve both insight and a traceable decision process.

## Guided numerical example: Plane-wall conduction: Q=kAΔT/L

**Given synthetic inputs.** k=0.04 W/(m K), A=2 m², ΔT=25 K, L=0.08 m.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `Plane-wall conduction: Q=kAΔT/L` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **25 W**. This is an illustrative arithmetic result, not a measured field or equipment rating. Preserve more precision during intermediate calculations than in the reported answer. If the output is a rate, do not confuse it with accumulated energy. If it is a temperature difference, distinguish it from absolute temperature. If it is nondimensional, the absence of units is a useful audit rather than permission to omit definitions.

**Physical interpretation.** Determine how the sign, scale and limiting cases match the original scenario. Recompute the result after raising a physically meaningful driving variable by 10%, but do not automatically assume a proportional change. The formula may contain an exponent, logarithm or regime-dependent coefficient, in which case its sensitivity varies with the operating point. Propose a second measurement that would check the prediction without merely feeding the same data into the same equation. A calibration check tests the measuring instrument, not necessarily the entire heat-transfer model.

## Derivation map and assumptions

1. Draw a control volume or differential element. Mark every mechanism that carries energy across its boundary and each mechanism that stores or generates it.
2. Choose a coordinate and sign convention, identify a characteristic length, and state whether the requested answer concerns an area, a volume, a point temperature or an integrated rate.
3. Write the governing differential or integral balance. Separate physical conservation from constitutive assumptions, geometric identities and empirical correlations.
4. Simplify only after stating the neglected processes. Common simplifications include negligible contact resistance, uniform fluid properties, quasi-steady conduction or constant wall temperature; each has a plausible failure condition.
5. Substitute values with their dimensions retained. Evaluate a limiting case: zero driving difference, vanishing thickness, extremely low coefficient, large elapsed time or another mathematically relevant limit.
6. Examine whether the dependent quantity could be independently observed and whether the observed conditions would reproduce the assumptions used in the calculation.

For this topic, A useful thermal resistance model begins with geometry. Draw an isotherm, then imagine a heat-flow line crossing it orthogonally for an isotropic solid. In fourier law through a plane wall, decide whether cross-sectional area changes along the path or whether a one-dimensional model is inadequate. Estimate how a small air gap, contact pressure, geometric corner or material junction could redirect flux. A measured temperature drop should agree with the signed energy flow through a passive path; a contradictory sign often indicates sensors installed in the wrong order or an omitted source.

## Engineering experiment and data interpretation

**Suggested investigation.** Compare three thicknesses and plot steady heat rate against inverse thickness. Do not invent real measurements; start with an explicit hypothetical dataset or collect readings under appropriate supervision. Specify the sensor location, thermal settling criterion, and calibration state. Record environmental conditions, because an apparently small change in ambient temperature can alter both boundary gradients and material properties. Identify a control run that removes the driving source or changes only one variable. Repeat at least one operating point to estimate repeatability rather than treating an isolated reading as exact.

A defensible report includes an annotated sketch, a units table, the raw readings, a method for reducing data and a statement of what cannot be inferred. If an inverse calculation uses a model to estimate a coefficient, do not then use the very same data as independent validation. Reserve at least one different condition or instrument for a fair check. The student should be able to explain why a significant discrepancy may indicate an incorrect thermal boundary rather than a mistaken calculator operation.

## Model limits, troubleshooting and safety

**Frequent mistake:** Forgetting that wall thickness is in metres or using the full wall area twice.

Diagnose the underlying reason instead of memorizing a warning. Ask what hidden assumption permits the easy formula to be written and what instrument would reveal its failure. A model may fail by incorrect dimensions, invalid regime, missing heat path, changing fluid property, an inappropriate temperature reference, or a neglected time-dependent term. Separate those failures from numerical mistakes and data-recording problems. Compare the predicted rate against any power or energy known to enter the system; a passive assembly cannot steadily deliver more energy than its stated supply without another source.

If the proposed object is a boiler, pressure vessel, battery pack, electrical appliance, medical device, industrial furnace or fire-safety system, this lesson supplies basic intuition only. Real design requires applicable codes, manufacturer data, validated correlations, abnormal-operation analysis and responsible professional review. The exploratory sliders in the companion models are not design certificates.

## Check your understanding — three problems

1. **Numerical variation.** Rework the example for a 15% increase in its driving thermal difference or equivalent controlling input. State the new units, compare changes as a percentage, and explain whether the relationship is truly linear at this point.
2. **Model selection.** Draw a different physical geometry or flow configuration where this equation might fail. Identify the precise assumption that breaks down, then propose a more suitable balance, correlation or measurement.
3. **Experimental critique.** Design a two-condition laboratory check of the guiding question. Specify a measurable dependent quantity, one plausible confounder, a calibration or repeatability step, and a criterion for recognizing a model–data disagreement.

## Extension: toward real engineering practice

Develop a small calculation sheet or script with named inputs, a units column and explicit warnings about any validity range. Test it at a nominal point and at two extremes, explaining whether the mathematics remains physically credible. Then imagine a colleague changed an input property without documenting temperature or source. Describe exactly how that would affect traceability and how you would reconstruct the decision. Finally propose one material, configuration or instrumentation change that improves thermal performance without adding unacceptable complexity or operating expense.

**Lesson conclusion.** Fourier law through a plane wall is useful when the energy pathway, geometry, regime and measurement basis agree. Recalculate when those conditions change; do not use apparent precision to hide uncertainty. Explain the result using a physical picture, not only a number.

**Unit 2: Steady Conduction and Thermal Resistance · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** Why does a thin, highly conductive sheet often contribute little resistance?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: Two layers, each 1 m², have L/k ratios 0.025 and 1.0 m²K/W; almost the full temperature drop is in the second. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Guided numerical example: Series-wall rate: Q=ΔT/R

**Given synthetic inputs.** A=1 m²; two layers L1=0.02 m, k1=0.8 and L2=1 m, k2=0.04.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `Series-wall rate: Q=ΔT/R` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **0.999 W**.

# U02-L03 — Radial conduction in cylinders and spheres

**Unit 2: Steady Conduction and Thermal Resistance · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** Why does an insulated pipe require logarithmic rather than planar geometry?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: For a cylindrical insulation annulus with radii 0.02 and 0.04 m, the area increases with radius. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes.

**Guiding question:** How does mechanical clamping improve conduction between an electronic chip and heat sink?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement.

# U02-L05 — Extended surfaces and fin efficiency

**Unit 2: Steady Conduction and Thermal Resistance · Suggested workload 90–130 minutes · Educational draft**

## Learning question and physical setting

**Guiding question:** When does adding more fin length stop giving a proportional heat-transfer gain?

The central task in this lesson is not merely to insert values into a formula. It is to decide whether the formula represents the physical process, whether the thermal boundary is correctly located, and whether the resulting quantity can be compared to a measurement. The setting is concrete: An aluminum fin of short length may be nearly isothermal while a much longer fin loses effectiveness. Begin by explaining the physical mechanism in ordinary language before drawing a thermal diagram. Decide which direction energy is expected to move, and identify at least one quantity that changes if the surrounding temperature or operating power changes. This turns a numerical problem into a model that could be revised when new evidence appears.

## Conceptual foundations and governing relationship

**Core relationship:** `ηf=tanh(mLc)/(mLc), m=sqrt(hP/(kAc))`.

A resistance network assumes an adequately one-dimensional heat path or a justified node approximation. The sum of temperature drops around a series path must equal the imposed difference. Parallel branches share terminal temperatures but carry different duties. Geometry changes the resistance: a flat slab has nearly constant area, whereas a pipe has growing cylindrical area. Contact resistance and convection can outweigh the material core. A finite contact area, thermal bridge or imperfect interface changes the answer in ways that cannot be corrected merely by adding more significant digits. The equation describes a particular kind of relation: sometimes a constitutive law, sometimes an integral energy balance, a nondimensional definition, a geometry-specific analytical solution, or a correlation validated only in an experimental range. Before using it, define each symbol and its units. State which values are measured, which are assumed, which are looked up, and which are inferred. Unlike an algebraic identity, a model may stop being valid when the shape, temperature distribution, flow regime, surface treatment or boundary conditions change. An answer that violates a conservation balance is unacceptable even if its arithmetic is flawless.

For **extended surfaces and fin efficiency**, sketch the physical domain and draw arrows for the relevant energy paths. A first approximation is useful when it makes the dominant mechanism visible. A more detailed approximation is useful only when an observation motivates the additional complexity. In each case, decide whether spatial temperature gradients are physically essential, whether heat is stored, and whether material properties can be treated as uniform. The goal is to preserve both insight and a traceable decision process.

## Guided numerical example: Fin efficiency: η=tanh(mL)/(mL)

**Given synthetic inputs.** h=18 W/(m² K), P=0.04 m, k=180 W/(m K), Ac=0.0001 m², L=0.08 m.

**Operation.** Use the relationship `Fin efficiency: η=tanh(mL)/(mL)` with all inputs converted to compatible units; the result is **0.9226 fraction**. This is an illustrative arithmetic result, not a measured field or equipment rating. Preserve more precision during intermediate calculations than in the reported answer. If the output is a rate, do not confuse it with accumulated energy. If it is a temperature difference, distinguish it from absolute temperature. If it is nondimensional, the absence of units is a useful audit rather than permission to omit definitions.

**Physical interpretation.** Determine how the sign, scale and limiting cases match the original scenario. Recompute the result after raising a physically meaningful driving variable by 10%, but do not automatically assume a proportional change. The formula may contain an exponent, logarithm or regime-dependent coefficient, in which case its sensitivity varies with the operating point. Propose a second measurement that would check the prediction without merely feeding the same data into the same equation. A calibration check tests the measuring instrument, not necessarily the entire heat-transfer model.

## Derivation map and assumptions

1. Draw a control volume or differential element. Mark every mechanism that carries energy across its boundary and each mechanism that stores or generates it.
2. Choose a coordinate and sign convention, identify a characteristic length, and state whether the requested answer concerns an area, a volume, a point temperature or an integrated rate.
3. Write the governing differential or integral balance. Separate physical conservation from constitutive assumptions, geometric identities and empirical correlations.
4. Simplify only after stating the neglected processes. Common simplifications include negligible contact resistance, uniform fluid properties, quasi-steady conduction or constant wall temperature; each has a plausible failure condition.
5. Substitute values with their dimensions retained. Evaluate a limiting case: zero driving difference, vanishing thickness, extremely low coefficient, large elapsed time or another mathematically relevant limit.
6. Examine whether the dependent quantity could be independently observed and whether the observed conditions would reproduce the assumptions used in the calculation.

For this topic, A useful thermal resistance model begins with geometry. Draw an isotherm, then imagine a heat-flow line crossing it orthogonally for an isotropic solid. In extended surfaces and fin efficiency, decide whether cross-sectional area changes along the path or whether a one-dimensional model is inadequate. Estimate how a small air gap, contact pressure, geometric corner or material junction could redirect flux. A measured temperature drop should agree with the signed energy flow through a passive path; a contradictory sign often indicates sensors installed in the wrong order or an omitted source.

## Engineering experiment and data interpretation

**Suggested investigation.** Compare measured fin temperatures at several axial positions to a one-dimensional prediction. Do not invent real measurements; start with an explicit hypothetical dataset or collect readings under appropriate supervision. Specify the sensor location, thermal settling criterion, and calibration state. Record environmental conditions, because an apparently small change in ambient temperature can alter both boundary gradients and material properties. Identify a control run that removes the driving source or changes only one variable. Repeat at least one operating point to estimate repeatability rather than treating an isolated reading as exact.

A defensible report includes an annotated sketch, a units table, the raw readings, a method for reducing data and a statement of what cannot be inferred. If an inverse calculation uses a model to estimate a coefficient, do not then use the very same data as independent validation. Reserve at least one different condition or instrument for a fair check. The student should be able to explain why a significant discrepancy may indicate an incorrect thermal boundary rather than a mistaken calculator operation.

## Model limits, troubleshooting and safety

**Frequent mistake:** Applying the infinite-fin model to a short fin without considering its tip boundary.

Diagnose the underlying reason instead of memorizing a warning. Ask what hidden assumption permits the easy formula to be written and what instrument would reveal its failure. A model may fail by incorrect dimensions, invalid regime, missing heat path, changing fluid property, an inappropriate temperature reference, or a neglected time-dependent term. Separate those failures from numerical mistakes and data-recording problems. Compare the predicted rate against any power or energy known to enter the system; a passive assembly cannot steadily deliver more energy than its stated supply without another source.

If the proposed object is a boiler, pressure vessel, battery pack, electrical appliance, medical device, industrial furnace or fire-safety system, this lesson supplies basic intuition only. Real design requires applicable codes, manufacturer data, validated correlations, abnormal-operation analysis and responsible professional review. The exploratory sliders in the companion models are not design certificates.

## Check your understanding — three problems

1. **Numerical variation.** Rework the example for a 15% increase in its driving thermal difference or equivalent controlling input. State the new units, compare changes as a percentage, and explain whether the relationship is truly linear at this point.
2. **Model selection.** Draw a different physical geometry or flow configuration where this equation might fail. Identify the precise assumption that breaks down, then propose a more suitable balance, correlation or measurement.
3. **Experimental critique.** Design a two-condition laboratory check of the guiding question. Specify a measurable dependent quantity, one plausible confounder, a calibration or repeatability step, and a criterion for recognizing a model–data disagreement.

## Extension: toward real engineering practice

Develop a small calculation sheet or script with named inputs, a units column and explicit warnings about any validity range. Test it at a nominal point and at two extremes, explaining whether the mathematics remains physically credible. Then imagine a colleague changed an input property without documenting temperature or source. Describe exactly how that would affect traceability and how you would reconstruct the decision. Finally propose one material, configuration or instrumentation change that improves thermal performance without adding unacceptable complexity or operating expense.

**Lesson conclusion.** Extended surfaces and fin efficiency is useful when the energy pathway, geometry, regime and measurement basis agree. Recalculate when those conditions change; do not use apparent precision to hide uncertainty. Explain the result using a physical picture, not only a number.
