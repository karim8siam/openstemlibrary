# U05-L01 — Differential-drive kinematics

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 5: Mobile Robotics, Localization and Mapping.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **differential-drive kinematics** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: An autonomous indoor cart transports parts between two guarded workstations. Model ground motion and infer location without confusing integrated odometry with an absolute position measurement. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Wheel angular motion produces body linear and angular velocity through wheel radii and axle track. No-slip differential-drive motion cannot create pure lateral body velocity; wheel saturation affects commanded curvature. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`v=(vR+vL)/2; omega=(vR-vL)/b`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Failure boundaries.** Derive a nominal prediction, then ask how it changes near a singularity, saturation threshold, sensor outage or geometric boundary. Mathematical formulas sometimes remain numerically defined after their physical hypotheses are violated. The validity envelope should be written before any plot is treated as a performance forecast. In this lesson, look specifically at **differential-drive kinematics** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** State estimation Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

For vR=0.60 m/s, vL=0.20 m/s and track b=0.50 m, body speed is 0.40 m/s and yaw rate 0.80 rad/s. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Boundary Cases audit.** Check a zero-input limit, a typical operating point and a maximum planned input. Where derivatives exist, estimate local sensitivity to a 5% change. If the result changes sharply, prioritize a measurement of the sensitive parameter rather than increasing numerical precision elsewhere. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Assuming slip-free odometry on polished or wet floors creates accumulating heading error. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

**Integration perspective.** Wheel odometry and inertial integration have drift; externally observed features can help but also suffer association ambiguity. Maintain a reference trajectory with known coordinates and timestamps. Report estimated uncertainty and actual held-out errors separately. For this topic, explicitly identify the preceding system function that supplies information and the following function that consumes the output. Give those interfaces names and units. State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Measure a set of straight and circular paths against floor markers or external tracking.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

**Failure analysis.** Slippery floors, missing landmarks or repeated corridor layouts can lead to large map error even if the reported covariance is small. Require a bounded fallback behavior under unresolved localization. When recorded evidence contradicts a prediction, preserve the discrepancy. Consider sensor bias, frame mismatch, uncontrolled load, aliasing, model order, compliance and operator intervention as competing explanations. One favorable trace does not validate a complete operating envelope. A reliable result needs repeatability across changed initial conditions and traceability to the configuration used for the test.

**Laboratory record.** Save model revision, input parameter table, raw data, units, frame definitions, timestamps, plot-generating script, calculated sensitivity and unsuccessful cases. Attach a short statement distinguishing simulation evidence from physical measurement and from a safety-related assessment. If equipment access is unavailable, provide a transparent synthetic test with expected results and avoid representing it as laboratory measurement.

## Exercises and design investigation

1. **Interpretation:** Derive or explain `v=(vR+vL)/2; omega=(vR-vL)/b` from relevant geometry, conservation laws or probability assumptions. Define all quantities, directions and units. Name a realistic boundary where it loses validity.
2. **Calculation:** Recompute the worked example without copying its result. Change the most important input by 10%; compare the resulting change against the original prediction, and explain when a first-order approximation is inadequate.
3. **Independent validation:** Construct a test of differential-drive kinematics using an independent reference. State three potential sources of measurement error and which observable can isolate at least two of them.
4. **Failure and safety:** Using the specified failure mechanism, write an expected fault signature, a detection threshold and a controlled fallback response. Distinguish the operating controller from a separately evaluated safety function.
5. **Applied synthesis:** For the unit's running case, document one viable alternative architecture, what it costs in complexity, and what evidence would justify choosing it over the baseline.

## Lesson summary and transfer

The central skill is to connect **differential-drive kinematics** to a physically meaningful model and a test that could disprove it. Carry the same units, coordinate conventions, uncertainty bounds and versioned acceptance criteria into the next lesson. Robot performance is judged by reproducible task outcomes under constrained conditions, not by an appealing ideal plot or the correctness of a single formula.

# U05-L02 — Wheel odometry and pose integration

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 5: Mobile Robotics, Localization and Mapping.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **wheel odometry and pose integration** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: An autonomous indoor cart transports parts between two guarded workstations. Model ground motion and infer location without confusing integrated odometry with an absolute position measurement. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Discrete wheel encoders estimate incremental traveled distance and heading. Approximate integration can work for short intervals but errors in wheel radius, track width and slip accumulate without bound on long open-loop runs. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`Delta_s=(Delta_sR+Delta_sL)/2`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Identification and calibration.** A single fitted parameter can conceal bias in a different component. If friction, encoder scale and controller gain all change together, the resulting trace does not identify their separate causes. Change a controlled input and compare with an independent instrument where possible. In this lesson, look specifically at **wheel odometry and pose integration** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** State estimation Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

Left travel 0.40 m and right travel 0.50 m imply nominal center travel 0.45 m between readings. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Discretization audit.** Choose a simulation step that resolves the fastest physical phenomenon of interest. Check convergence with a smaller step and confirm that numerical artifacts do not explain apparent stability or contact behavior. Sampling rates must exceed the bandwidth of the phenomena they are claimed to detect. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Wheel diameter mismatch creates systematic curvature during supposedly straight drives. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Drive both directions over known distances and compare odometry with independent surveyed endpoints.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

# U05-L03 — Inertial and visual sensor fusion

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 5: Mobile Robotics, Localization and Mapping.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **inertial and visual sensor fusion** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: An autonomous indoor cart transports parts between two guarded workstations. Model ground motion and infer location without confusing integrated odometry with an absolute position measurement. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Gyroscopes offer good short-time angular rate but drift; cameras provide environmental constraints but fail under texture loss, lighting changes or blurred motion. A fusion estimator requires time synchronization and defensible noise assumptions. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`theta_new=theta_old+omega*dt`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Implementation choice.** The lightest controller or cheapest sensor is not automatically the best solution. Complexity can improve diagnostics yet add failure modes and maintenance obligations. Define what a more advanced method would need to prove under representative loads, timing, environment and budget. In this lesson, look specifically at **inertial and visual sensor fusion** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** State estimation Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

A residual gyro bias 0.1°/s accumulates about 6° heading error over one minute if uncorrected. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Uncertainty audit.** Differentiate precision from accuracy: repeated values near one another may share a systematic offset. Use replicated trials and a calibration reference, and consider correlations when combining uncertainties. An error bound must be linked to a defined operating range. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** A delayed camera frame is fused as if it had the latest timestamp, introducing a false position correction. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Run repeat routes with intentionally varied lighting and compare estimates against a separate reference.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

# U05-L04 — Occupancy grids and mapping uncertainty

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 5: Mobile Robotics, Localization and Mapping.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **occupancy grids and mapping uncertainty** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: An autonomous indoor cart transports parts between two guarded workstations. Model ground motion and infer location without confusing integrated odometry with an absolute position measurement. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** An occupancy grid represents belief that cells are occupied, not a binary map of truth. Bayesian updates combine prior and sensor likelihoods, while correlated observations must not be treated as independent evidence. Ray casting and inverse sensor models each have assumptions. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`P(occ|z)=P(z|occ)P(occ)/P(z)`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Operational consequence.** A robot cell has no isolated subsystem outcomes. A high-accuracy reach solution can be invalidated by perception latency, a good gripper can fail on a different surface, and a fast conveyor can overwhelm fault handling. Preserve interface specifications and model uncertainty across design stages. In this lesson, look specifically at **occupancy grids and mapping uncertainty** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** State estimation Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

With prior occupancy 0.50, detection probability 0.80 and false-positive rate 0.20, a positive report yields posterior occupancy 0.80. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Traceable Verification audit.** Record firmware or model version, sensor calibration, test fixture revision and all rejected trials. Set acceptance thresholds before viewing the final traces. If a physical trial cannot be carried out safely, use simulation only and write the missing validation item explicitly. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably.

A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Repeated identical false positives drive overconfidence when observation correlations are ignored. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Compare grid predictions against independently measured obstacle locations and inspect calibration residuals.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis.

# U05-L05 — Localization failure and recovery

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 5: Mobile Robotics, Localization and Mapping.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **localization failure and recovery** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: An autonomous indoor cart transports parts between two guarded workstations. Model ground motion and infer location without confusing integrated odometry with an absolute position measurement. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Global localization, kidnapped-robot recovery and map changes require explicit integrity checks. A confident pose covariance is not proof of correctness when the estimator has converged to the wrong corridor. Design bounded stops under ambiguous localization. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`error=||p_est-p_reference||_2`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Physical interpretation.** Place the governing relationship beside a sketch with vectors, directions and units. Identify which terms are geometry, which describe dynamics, and which are sensor-derived approximations. The useful question is not simply whether software returns a number, but whether the quantity corresponds to a well-defined physical observation. In this lesson, look specifically at **localization failure and recovery** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** State estimation Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

For planar errors 0.12 m and 0.05 m, Euclidean position error is 0.13 m. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Dimensional Balance audit.** Perform a units check by substituting SI base units and showing both sides match. For angles, state that trigonometric functions expect radians unless explicitly converted. For probabilities, check output within [0,1], and for lengths or times reject negative values when the model defines only positive quantities. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Ambiguous repeated shelving makes the robot confidently localize one aisle away. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

**Integration perspective.** Wheel odometry and inertial integration have drift; externally observed features can help but also suffer association ambiguity. Maintain a reference trajectory with known coordinates and timestamps. Report estimated uncertainty and actual held-out errors separately. For this topic, explicitly identify the preceding system function that supplies information and the following function that consumes the output. Give those interfaces names and units. State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Evaluate recovery after controlled loss of visual landmarks in a contained simulation or supervised low-speed trial.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

**Failure analysis.** Slippery floors, missing landmarks or repeated corridor layouts can lead to large map error even if the reported covariance is small. Require a bounded fallback behavior under unresolved localization. When recorded evidence contradicts a prediction, preserve the discrepancy. Consider sensor bias, frame mismatch, uncontrolled load, aliasing, model order, compliance and operator intervention as competing explanations. One favorable trace does not validate a complete operating envelope. A reliable result needs repeatability across changed initial conditions and traceability to the configuration used for the test.

**Laboratory record.** Save model revision, input parameter table, raw data, units, frame definitions, timestamps, plot-generating script, calculated sensitivity and unsuccessful cases. Attach a short statement distinguishing simulation evidence from physical measurement and from a safety-related assessment. If equipment access is unavailable, provide a transparent synthetic test with expected results and avoid representing it as laboratory measurement.

## Exercises and design investigation

1. **Interpretation:** Derive or explain `error=||p_est-p_reference||_2` from relevant geometry, conservation laws or probability assumptions. Define all quantities, directions and units. Name a realistic boundary where it loses validity.
2. **Calculation:** Recompute the worked example without copying its result. Change the most important input by 10%; compare the resulting change against the original prediction, and explain when a first-order approximation is inadequate.
3. **Independent validation:** Construct a test of localization failure and recovery using an independent reference. State three potential sources of measurement error and which observable can isolate at least two of them.
4. **Failure and safety:** Using the specified failure mechanism, write an expected fault signature, a detection threshold and a controlled fallback response. Distinguish the operating controller from a separately evaluated safety function.
5. **Applied synthesis:** For the unit's running case, document one viable alternative architecture, what it costs in complexity, and what evidence would justify choosing it over the baseline.

## Lesson summary and transfer

The central skill is to connect **localization failure and recovery** to a physically meaningful model and a test that could disprove it. Carry the same units, coordinate conventions, uncertainty bounds and versioned acceptance criteria into the next lesson. Robot performance is judged by reproducible task outcomes under constrained conditions, not by an appealing ideal plot or the correctness of a single formula.
