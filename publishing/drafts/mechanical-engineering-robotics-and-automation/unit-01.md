# U01-L01 — Robot classes and degrees of freedom

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 1: Robot Architecture, Workcells and Requirements.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **robot classes and degrees of freedom** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: A robotic packing cell loads fragile cartons from a conveyor into a tote while people perform replenishment. Establish what the robot must do, its mechanical and informational boundaries, and how a requirement will be verified. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Cartesian, SCARA, articulated, parallel and mobile robots differ in their joint topology and accessible orientation. Count independent configuration coordinates rather than assuming the number of motors equals task-space degrees of freedom. A redundant robot can satisfy the same end-effector pose with multiple joint combinations. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`M = number of independent generalized coordinates`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Operational consequence.** A robot cell has no isolated subsystem outcomes. A high-accuracy reach solution can be invalidated by perception latency, a good gripper can fail on a different surface, and a fast conveyor can overwhelm fault handling. Preserve interface specifications and model uncertainty across design stages. In this lesson, look specifically at **robot classes and degrees of freedom** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** Requirement decomposition Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

A six-revolute-joint arm normally needs six independent coordinates to state its nominal configuration, although joint limits and singularities constrain useful motion. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Discretization audit.** Choose a simulation step that resolves the fastest physical phenomenon of interest. Check convergence with a smaller step and confirm that numerical artifacts do not explain apparent stability or contact behavior. Sampling rates must exceed the bandwidth of the phenomena they are claimed to detect. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Counting a passive linkage as an independently controllable axis produces impossible reach and cycle-time claims. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

**Integration perspective.** Use a system boundary around the conveyor, controller, arm and operator-facing interface. Mark energy, material and information crossing that boundary. Compute the complete station cycle instead of treating arm-only motion as the system result. For this topic, explicitly identify the preceding system function that supplies information and the following function that consumes the output. Give those interfaces names and units. State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Make a joint and constraint table for the candidate layouts and independently confirm reachable poses by kinematic solving.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

**Failure analysis.** Unexpected restart, an obstructed detection area or an unacknowledged part-ready signal should move coordination to a defined recoverable state. A guard or emergency protective function cannot be replaced by an ordinary message timeout. When recorded evidence contradicts a prediction, preserve the discrepancy. Consider sensor bias, frame mismatch, uncontrolled load, aliasing, model order, compliance and operator intervention as competing explanations. One favorable trace does not validate a complete operating envelope. A reliable result needs repeatability across changed initial conditions and traceability to the configuration used for the test.

**Laboratory record.** Save model revision, input parameter table, raw data, units, frame definitions, timestamps, plot-generating script, calculated sensitivity and unsuccessful cases. Attach a short statement distinguishing simulation evidence from physical measurement and from a safety-related assessment. If equipment access is unavailable, provide a transparent synthetic test with expected results and avoid representing it as laboratory measurement.

## Exercises and design investigation

1. **Interpretation:** Derive or explain `M = number of independent generalized coordinates` from relevant geometry, conservation laws or probability assumptions. Define all quantities, directions and units. Name a realistic boundary where it loses validity.
2. **Calculation:** Recompute the worked example without copying its result. Change the most important input by 10%; compare the resulting change against the original prediction, and explain when a first-order approximation is inadequate.
3. **Independent validation:** Construct a test of robot classes and degrees of freedom using an independent reference. State three potential sources of measurement error and which observable can isolate at least two of them.
4. **Failure and safety:** Using the specified failure mechanism, write an expected fault signature, a detection threshold and a controlled fallback response. Distinguish the operating controller from a separately evaluated safety function.
5. **Applied synthesis:** For the unit's running case, document one viable alternative architecture, what it costs in complexity, and what evidence would justify choosing it over the baseline.

## Lesson summary and transfer

The central skill is to connect **robot classes and degrees of freedom** to a physically meaningful model and a test that could disprove it. Carry the same units, coordinate conventions, uncertainty bounds and versioned acceptance criteria into the next lesson. Robot performance is judged by reproducible task outcomes under constrained conditions, not by an appealing ideal plot or the correctness of a single formula.

# U01-L02 — Task specification and measurable throughput

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 1: Robot Architecture, Workcells and Requirements.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **task specification and measurable throughput** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: A robotic packing cell loads fragile cartons from a conveyor into a tote while people perform replenishment. Establish what the robot must do, its mechanical and informational boundaries, and how a requirement will be verified. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Convert a production promise into object sizes, rate, pose accuracy, missed pick allowance, tool-change time, exceptional states and product variability. Distinguish mean cycle time from a conservative worst-case. Throughput is a measured process output, not the reciprocal of nominal arm travel alone. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`pieces/hour = 3600 * availability / cycle_time`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Physical interpretation.** Place the governing relationship beside a sketch with vectors, directions and units. Identify which terms are geometry, which describe dynamics, and which are sensor-derived approximations. The useful question is not simply whether software returns a number, but whether the quantity corresponds to a well-defined physical observation. In this lesson, look specifically at **task specification and measurable throughput** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** Requirement decomposition Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

At a 4.5 s full handling cycle and 0.85 productive fraction, nominal capacity is 680 successful cycles/hour before reject handling. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Uncertainty audit.** Differentiate precision from accuracy: repeated values near one another may share a systematic offset. Use replicated trials and a calibration reference, and consider correlations when combining uncertainties. An error bound must be linked to a defined operating range. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Ignoring jams, replenishment and retried grasps inflates the rate quoted to a factory. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Log completed good cartons, rejected attempts, queue length and interruptions during a representative timed run.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

# U01-L03 — Coordinate-frame conventions

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 1: Robot Architecture, Workcells and Requirements.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **coordinate-frame conventions** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: A robotic packing cell loads fragile cartons from a conveyor into a tote while people perform replenishment. Establish what the robot must do, its mechanical and informational boundaries, and how a requirement will be verified. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Attach a right-handed frame to the cell, base, tool flange, object and each sensor. Homogeneous transforms describe composition of rotation and translation, while the order of multiplication matters. Declare the direction encoded by each matrix and whether angles are radians or degrees. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`p_world = T_world_base * T_base_tool * p_tool`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Failure boundaries.** Derive a nominal prediction, then ask how it changes near a singularity, saturation threshold, sensor outage or geometric boundary. Mathematical formulas sometimes remain numerically defined after their physical hypotheses are violated. The validity envelope should be written before any plot is treated as a performance forecast. In this lesson, look specifically at **coordinate-frame conventions** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** Requirement decomposition Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

A tool point 0.10 m along a base-aligned axis from a base origin at x=0.70 m has world x=0.80 m; a rotated tool requires the full transform. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Traceable Verification audit.** Record firmware or model version, sensor calibration, test fixture revision and all rejected trials. Set acceptance thresholds before viewing the final traces. If a physical trial cannot be carried out safely, use simulation only and write the missing validation item explicitly. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Mixing frame directions moves the tool to a plausible but incorrect Cartesian location. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Move a calibrated pointer to several fiducials and compare measured coordinates with independently transformed predictions.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

# U01-L04 — Automation cell interfaces

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 1: Robot Architecture, Workcells and Requirements.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **automation cell interfaces** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: A robotic packing cell loads fragile cartons from a conveyor into a tote while people perform replenishment. Establish what the robot must do, its mechanical and informational boundaries, and how a requirement will be verified. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** A robot controller exchanges part-ready, motion-complete, zone-clear and fault signals with conveyors, grippers and supervisory software. Specify who owns each state transition and what happens if a message arrives late or twice. Separate coordination signals from independent safeguarding functions. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`t_cycle = t_detect + t_move + t_grip + t_place + t_reset`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Identification and calibration.** A single fitted parameter can conceal bias in a different component. If friction, encoder scale and controller gain all change together, the resulting trace does not identify their separate causes. Change a controlled input and compare with an independent instrument where possible. In this lesson, look specifically at **automation cell interfaces** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** Requirement decomposition Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

Segments of 0.10, 1.20, 0.25, 1.05 and 0.40 s yield 3.00 s nominal, excluding overlap and recovery. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Dimensional Balance audit.** Perform a units check by substituting SI base units and showing both sides match. For angles, state that trigonometric functions expect radians unless explicitly converted. For probabilities, check output within [0,1], and for lengths or times reject negative values when the model defines only positive quantities. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** A stale part-ready signal triggers a second grasp after the carton has moved. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Inject delayed and duplicate non-safety messages in simulation and verify idempotent state transitions.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

# U01-L05 — Hazard identification and protective design

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering · Book 12: Robotics and Automation · Unit 1: Robot Architecture, Workcells and Requirements.** Educational draft. All worked numbers are illustrative unless stated otherwise; do not use the calculations alone to certify a physical robot or protective system.

## Learning goal and context

This lesson asks how **hazard identification and protective design** affects a realistic robotic system. Its running design problem is: A robotic packing cell loads fragile cartons from a conveyor into a tote while people perform replenishment. Establish what the robot must do, its mechanical and informational boundaries, and how a requirement will be verified. Students must explain the physical mechanism, calculate an interpretable quantity, identify an assumption that could fail, and propose an observation that would distinguish competing explanations.

**Entry-level reasoning.** Stored energy, falling loads, pinch points, unexpectedly restored power and people entering a work envelope demand systematic risk assessment. A normal task-completion bit is not equivalent to a protective stop. Safety functions need independent qualified engineering evaluation and applicable current standards. In practice, begin with the machine boundary and mark the frames, joint connections, sensing path and source of power. If a controller reports a requested value, determine whether the value is a command, a filtered estimate, an independently measured result or an offline ideal prediction. These are not interchangeable. Write a short claim that would be falsified by an observed counterexample, rather than a claim that can be rescued by changing assumptions after the experiment.

## Derivation, model and interpretation

A compact starting equation or relationship is **`E_kinetic = 0.5 * m * v^2`**. Define every symbol, include appropriate physical units and interpret the input and output quantities. The displayed relationship may be exact within an ideal geometry, a simplification of more complete dynamics, or a statistical approximation. Its status must be recorded. When the formula requires constant dimensions or a fixed reference frame, note these conditions explicitly. A coordinate-dependent result is meaningless until frame orientation and origin are identified.

**Implementation choice.** The lightest controller or cheapest sensor is not automatically the best solution. Complexity can improve diagnostics yet add failure modes and maintenance obligations. Define what a more advanced method would need to prove under representative loads, timing, environment and budget. In this lesson, look specifically at **hazard identification and protective design** rather than copying a generic control diagram. Ask which model terms could be measured directly. For each unmeasured quantity, give a method for identification and state what additional assumptions that method requires.

**Submodel and system boundary.** Requirement decomposition Distinguish the ideal mathematical transformation from the mechanical or software device implementing it. For example, a calculated path requires a motion executor, a sensor-based termination rule and an independently assessed response to loss of communication. A fully specified algorithm can still be unsuitable for hardware when the necessary observations arrive too late.

## Worked calculation and numerical judgment

A 3 kg moving payload at 1.2 m/s has 2.16 J translational kinetic energy, excluding manipulator links. Reproduce the substitution on paper, carry units through each stage and check the scale with an independent estimate. Precision in displayed decimal places does not demonstrate precise knowledge of link lengths, accelerations, friction coefficients or camera calibration. If inputs are rounded or synthetic, the outputs inherit those limitations; do not label them as measured robot performance.

**Boundary Cases audit.** Check a zero-input limit, a typical operating point and a maximum planned input. Where derivatives exist, estimate local sensitivity to a 5% change. If the result changes sharply, prioritize a measurement of the sensitive parameter rather than increasing numerical precision elsewhere. Extend the example by sweeping one independent input through a realistic range. Predict the qualitative trend before computing. Then change another input in a separate run; explain why changing both simultaneously would make causal interpretation weaker. Document any singular, discontinuous or saturating regime instead of hiding it by clipping a plot without explanation.

## Engineering interpretation and practical alternatives

The principal design trade-off is between algorithmic or mechanical capability and the evidence needed to operate it reliably. A high-speed option may increase throughput but increase motor heating and the consequence of a delayed stop. A sophisticated estimator may reduce drift under good lighting but fail abruptly when landmarks disappear. A carefully bounded simpler system can therefore outperform a more elaborate system under the actual operating conditions.

**Specific failure mechanism.** Software-only limits are treated as safeguarding despite common-cause sensor and logic faults. Do not respond automatically by increasing controller gain or changing a threshold. State what instrument or independent observation would reveal the difference between a bad model, incorrect calibration, measurement delay and a mechanical fault. Consider the consequences for neighboring subsystems: sensing errors affect grasp decisions, trajectory errors affect collision risk, and recovery behavior affects throughput.

**Integration perspective.** Use a system boundary around the conveyor, controller, arm and operator-facing interface. Mark energy, material and information crossing that boundary. Compute the complete station cycle instead of treating arm-only motion as the system result. For this topic, explicitly identify the preceding system function that supplies information and the following function that consumes the output. Give those interfaces names and units. State whether data is real time, sampled, batch-produced or only available after an operation ends. Wrong timing semantics can invalidate a mathematically correct equation.

## Verification protocol and evidence quality

A falsifiable check is: **Document hazards, intended safeguards and proof-test evidence; carry out nonhazardous fault exercises only in a guarded configuration.** Establish independent observations whenever practical. Define an input range, number of trials, logging rate, expected trend, calibration reference and an acceptance threshold selected before analysis. At minimum include a nominal trial, a limiting case and an innocuous fault or missing-data condition. Physically hazardous failure injection requires qualified supervision and appropriate containment; otherwise conduct the test virtually and describe that limitation.

**Failure analysis.** Unexpected restart, an obstructed detection area or an unacknowledged part-ready signal should move coordination to a defined recoverable state. A guard or emergency protective function cannot be replaced by an ordinary message timeout. When recorded evidence contradicts a prediction, preserve the discrepancy. Consider sensor bias, frame mismatch, uncontrolled load, aliasing, model order, compliance and operator intervention as competing explanations. One favorable trace does not validate a complete operating envelope. A reliable result needs repeatability across changed initial conditions and traceability to the configuration used for the test.

**Laboratory record.** Save model revision, input parameter table, raw data, units, frame definitions, timestamps, plot-generating script, calculated sensitivity and unsuccessful cases. Attach a short statement distinguishing simulation evidence from physical measurement and from a safety-related assessment. If equipment access is unavailable, provide a transparent synthetic test with expected results and avoid representing it as laboratory measurement.

## Exercises and design investigation

1. **Interpretation:** Derive or explain `E_kinetic = 0.5 * m * v^2` from relevant geometry, conservation laws or probability assumptions. Define all quantities, directions and units. Name a realistic boundary where it loses validity.
2. **Calculation:** Recompute the worked example without copying its result. Change the most important input by 10%; compare the resulting change against the original prediction, and explain when a first-order approximation is inadequate.
3. **Independent validation:** Construct a test of hazard identification and protective design using an independent reference. State three potential sources of measurement error and which observable can isolate at least two of them.
4. **Failure and safety:** Using the specified failure mechanism, write an expected fault signature, a detection threshold and a controlled fallback response. Distinguish the operating controller from a separately evaluated safety function.
5. **Applied synthesis:** For the unit's running case, document one viable alternative architecture, what it costs in complexity, and what evidence would justify choosing it over the baseline.

## Lesson summary and transfer

The central skill is to connect **hazard identification and protective design** to a physically meaningful model and a test that could disprove it. Carry the same units, coordinate conventions, uncertainty bounds and versioned acceptance criteria into the next lesson. Robot performance is judged by reproducible task outcomes under constrained conditions, not by an appealing ideal plot or the correctness of a single formula.
