## Learning objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to (1) construct a defensible simplified model of **base-motion equations**, (2) explain the cause-and-effect relationship between its parameters and the observable output, (3) reproduce the quantitative screening example without losing units, (4) identify a realistic failure of the model, and (5) propose a repeatable experiment or sensor strategy. The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

For base motion y(t), the absolute mass motion x obeys m x¨+c(x˙-y˙)+k(x-y)=0; relative motion z=x-y has effective inertia forcing -m y¨.

**Running example.** A vibration table imposes a 2 mm support displacement near the mount natural frequency. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system. In particular, a displacement reported in millimeters can be either motion in an inertial frame or the difference between two moving points. The two quantities lead to different interpretations of isolation performance and dynamic stress.

A vibration model begins with inertia and a mechanism that transfers forces or energy. Inertia resists acceleration, elastic stiffness supplies a position-dependent restoring force, and mechanical damping removes energy through irreversible processes. A machine may also have forcing from unbalance, pressure pulses, electromagnetic torque, gear contact, road or floor input, or deliberate actuation. Do not include all these effects by default. Begin by isolating the mechanism suggested by the observed response, then test whether omitted effects matter at the operating point. If a linear model cannot reproduce amplitude, phase and frequency dependence together, the disagreement may identify additional physics, rather than an arithmetic problem.

The central interpretive question is not whether an equation has been solved, but whether its dependent variable corresponds to the requested decision. A natural frequency does not alone tell how large the motion will be; frequency of forcing and damping matter as well. Likewise, a reduction in displacement can coincide with a rise in acceleration if the frequency has changed. When comparing candidates, state whether you are minimizing motion, transmitted force, stress, sound, instrument error, fatigue or some weighted combination of those outcomes. These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** For r=2 and ζ=0.1, absolute displacement ratio sqrt((1+(2ζr)^2)/((1-r²)^2+(2ζr)^2))≈0.356.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution. Decide whether an amplitude is peak, peak-to-peak or RMS and maintain that convention throughout. Unless the input is a clean harmonic, conversions such as a_peak=ω²X_peak or v_RMS=v_peak/sqrt(2) should not be applied blindly. Where a model assumes a single mode or one-dimensional motion, describe the coordinate that stands in for the true three-dimensional structure.

A useful consistency check is to alter one parameter before making the final decision. Increasing mass at fixed stiffness lowers the natural frequency; increasing stiffness at fixed mass raises it. Damping generally decreases resonant amplification but can increase high-frequency force transmission. Increasing harmonic forcing frequency changes the inertial contribution quadratically. These tendencies apply only within the model that produced them: changes in geometry, preload, temperature, amplitude or joint contact can change mass distribution or stiffness at the same time. A model can be dimensionally correct and still physically wrong because it predicts a quantity no sensor actually measures.

## Worked engineering interpretation

Return to the case: A vibration table imposes a 2 mm support displacement near the mount natural frequency. The screening result is useful for sizing a measurement range, identifying a suspected mode or testing whether an operating frequency overlaps a predicted response band. It is not a certification result. State the inputs you can actually measure, the ones you have merely assumed, and the likely interval of uncertainty. If two configurations differ by less than measurement variation, choosing the numerically better result is unjustified. For a machine with significant temperature changes, test cold and hot states; for a rotating machine, compare the speed sweep in both directions; for a flexible frame, check whether the fixture and mounting method influence the identified mode.

Introduce a second parameter set, changing one input by 10% while holding the others fixed. Predict the sign of the change before calculating. If the sign differs, identify whether the example crossed a resonance or a stability condition, used the wrong output definition, or violated the small-motion assumption. Record a baseline parameter table with source, unit, uncertainty and date. When the mathematical response is highly sensitive to a small change, refine the test plan before declaring that the first design works.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** This ratio is for absolute displacement, not relative displacement, transmitted force, or acceleration of an arbitrary coupled frame. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum. If a simulation forecasts safe operation but measured vibration increases, stop escalating excitation and investigate the disagreement under controlled conditions. The responsibility to establish safe operating procedures, guards, machine access and acceptance limits belongs to qualified engineering personnel.

One way to diagnose discrepancy is to compare three distinct representations: a time trace, a spectrum or frequency-response curve, and a simple physical sketch of the expected motion. The time trace reveals clipping, impulses, drifting offsets and intermittent contact. The spectrum identifies periodic orders and broadband content but loses much time-localized information. The sketch tests whether the sensor direction can observe the hypothesized mode. A well-fitted numerical peak cannot establish a mechanism if the proposed mode shape is incompatible with the structure.

For measurement, **Mount an independent floor sensor and machine sensor to measure amplitude ratio and phase.** Measure more than once under a documented load and speed; preserve settings and raw traces. A single amplitude without its frequency band, operating state, transducer orientation and convention is inadequate for comparison. Report model residuals where possible, and identify one datum that could prove the model false. The most useful conclusion may be that a simplified model is insufficient and a more complete test is required.

## Relations to nearby lessons

This lesson builds on **the previous unit foundation** and prepares for **Isolation frequency ratio**. These connections matter because the motion predicted in one lesson becomes a forcing input or boundary condition in another. The algebra may look similar while the physical question changes: free response is not forced response, absolute displacement is not relative travel, and a modal natural frequency is not necessarily the frequency of peak operational vibration. Carry definitions of coordinates, units and assumptions forward; do not carry numerical values forward without checking whether the system has changed.

## Guided exercises and assessment

1. **Derivation:** Starting with a labeled free-body diagram or energy balance, derive or explain the screening relationship in this lesson. Show units and confirm at least one limiting case.
2. **Numerical sensitivity:** Recalculate the illustrative case with a 10% change in the parameter most likely to vary in service. Compare the relative change in output with the input change. State whether a linear approximation is justified.
3. **Measurement plan:** For “A vibration table imposes a 2 mm support displacement near the mount natural frequency.”, choose sensor positions and quantities to measure, and specify a sampling or repeatability requirement. What observation would contradict the simple model?
4. **Model criticism:** Explain exactly why the following warning could overturn a proposed selection: This ratio is for absolute displacement, not relative displacement, transmitted force, or acceleration of an arbitrary coupled frame.
5. **Design trade-off:** Compare two possible interventions, one changing inertia or stiffness and the other changing damping or forcing. Explain which practical requirement each intervention might worsen.
6. **Technical communication:** Write a short decision record separating a model-based prediction, an independent measurement, and a required acceptance condition. Explicitly label any unavailable evidence.

**Self-check:** Explain your result in physical words before looking again at the equation. If its magnitude or trend would surprise an engineer watching the mechanism move, review its coordinate, unit conversions, excitation type and validity limits. Do not use any draft value as an equipment setting without a complete review.

# U04-L02 — Isolation frequency ratio

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 4: Base Excitation and Vibration Isolation | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

## Learning objectives

The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

Displacement transmissibility for a linear SDOF base input drops below unity when r>sqrt(2), independent of ζ for the standard viscous model.

**Running example.** A machine with 8 Hz supported natural frequency must reject a 30 Hz floor tone. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system. In particular, a displacement reported in millimeters can be either motion in an inertial frame or the difference between two moving points.

When comparing candidates, state whether you are minimizing motion, transmitted force, stress, sound, instrument error, fatigue or some weighted combination of those outcomes. These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** r=30/8=3.75, comfortably above sqrt(2).

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** Softer mounts can compromise static deflection, travel, start/stop resonance and lateral stability. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum.

Report model residuals where possible, and identify one datum that could prove the model false.

# U04-L03 — Force transmissibility

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 4: Base Excitation and Vibration Isolation | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

Transmitted harmonic force includes elastic and damping components; for external harmonic force the ratio |F_trans|/F0=sqrt(1+(2ζr)^2)/sqrt((1-r²)^2+(2ζr)^2).

**Running example.** A motor is supported on elastomer pads and foundation force must be reduced. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system.

These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** At r=3 and ζ=0.10, force transmissibility≈0.145.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** A real foundation has its own modes, and multiple forcing directions invalidate one-axis estimates. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum.

The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

A soft isolation system may lower acceleration during a short shock but increase relative displacement and bottoming risk.

**Running example.** An instrument package experiences a transport acceleration pulse of short duration. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system.

These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** For an ideal impulse changing velocity by 0.5 m/s and ω_n=20 rad/s, undamped relative peak≈0.025 m.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** This is not an arbitrary pulse response; finite duration, damping and impact stops change the actual maximum.

# U04-L05 — Designing an isolation package

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 4: Base Excitation and Vibration Isolation | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

## Learning objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to (1) construct a defensible simplified model of **designing an isolation package**, (2) explain the cause-and-effect relationship between its parameters and the observable output, (3) reproduce the quantitative screening example without losing units, (4) identify a realistic failure of the model, and (5) propose a repeatable experiment or sensor strategy. The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

Practical mount selection balances frequency ratio, static load, stiffness, damping, geometry, temperature, aging and operating speed range.

**Running example.** Four mounts support a 120 kg assembly that moves between rooms on a wheeled platform. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system. In particular, a displacement reported in millimeters can be either motion in an inertial frame or the difference between two moving points. The two quantities lead to different interpretations of isolation performance and dynamic stress.

A vibration model begins with inertia and a mechanism that transfers forces or energy. Inertia resists acceleration, elastic stiffness supplies a position-dependent restoring force, and mechanical damping removes energy through irreversible processes. A machine may also have forcing from unbalance, pressure pulses, electromagnetic torque, gear contact, road or floor input, or deliberate actuation. Do not include all these effects by default. Begin by isolating the mechanism suggested by the observed response, then test whether omitted effects matter at the operating point. If a linear model cannot reproduce amplitude, phase and frequency dependence together, the disagreement may identify additional physics, rather than an arithmetic problem.

The central interpretive question is not whether an equation has been solved, but whether its dependent variable corresponds to the requested decision. A natural frequency does not alone tell how large the motion will be; frequency of forcing and damping matter as well. Likewise, a reduction in displacement can coincide with a rise in acceleration if the frequency has changed. When comparing candidates, state whether you are minimizing motion, transmitted force, stress, sound, instrument error, fatigue or some weighted combination of those outcomes. These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** Each equal mount carries mg/4≈294 N for g=9.81 m/s².

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution. Decide whether an amplitude is peak, peak-to-peak or RMS and maintain that convention throughout. Unless the input is a clean harmonic, conversions such as a_peak=ω²X_peak or v_RMS=v_peak/sqrt(2) should not be applied blindly. Where a model assumes a single mode or one-dimensional motion, describe the coordinate that stands in for the true three-dimensional structure.

A useful consistency check is to alter one parameter before making the final decision. Increasing mass at fixed stiffness lowers the natural frequency; increasing stiffness at fixed mass raises it. Damping generally decreases resonant amplification but can increase high-frequency force transmission. Increasing harmonic forcing frequency changes the inertial contribution quadratically. These tendencies apply only within the model that produced them: changes in geometry, preload, temperature, amplitude or joint contact can change mass distribution or stiffness at the same time. A model can be dimensionally correct and still physically wrong because it predicts a quantity no sensor actually measures.

## Worked engineering interpretation

Return to the case: Four mounts support a 120 kg assembly that moves between rooms on a wheeled platform. The screening result is useful for sizing a measurement range, identifying a suspected mode or testing whether an operating frequency overlaps a predicted response band. It is not a certification result. State the inputs you can actually measure, the ones you have merely assumed, and the likely interval of uncertainty. If two configurations differ by less than measurement variation, choosing the numerically better result is unjustified. For a machine with significant temperature changes, test cold and hot states; for a rotating machine, compare the speed sweep in both directions; for a flexible frame, check whether the fixture and mounting method influence the identified mode.

Introduce a second parameter set, changing one input by 10% while holding the others fixed. Predict the sign of the change before calculating. If the sign differs, identify whether the example crossed a resonance or a stability condition, used the wrong output definition, or violated the small-motion assumption. Record a baseline parameter table with source, unit, uncertainty and date. When the mathematical response is highly sensitive to a small change, refine the test plan before declaring that the first design works.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** Equal static shares require compatible center-of-mass location and mount stiffness; overturning and dynamics redistribute force. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum. If a simulation forecasts safe operation but measured vibration increases, stop escalating excitation and investigate the disagreement under controlled conditions. The responsibility to establish safe operating procedures, guards, machine access and acceptance limits belongs to qualified engineering personnel.

One way to diagnose discrepancy is to compare three distinct representations: a time trace, a spectrum or frequency-response curve, and a simple physical sketch of the expected motion. The time trace reveals clipping, impulses, drifting offsets and intermittent contact. The spectrum identifies periodic orders and broadband content but loses much time-localized information. The sketch tests whether the sensor direction can observe the hypothesized mode. A well-fitted numerical peak cannot establish a mechanism if the proposed mode shape is incompatible with the structure.

For measurement, **Measure load distribution and retest after the final payload and cable routing are installed.** Measure more than once under a documented load and speed; preserve settings and raw traces. A single amplitude without its frequency band, operating state, transducer orientation and convention is inadequate for comparison. Report model residuals where possible, and identify one datum that could prove the model false. The most useful conclusion may be that a simplified model is insufficient and a more complete test is required.

## Relations to nearby lessons

This lesson builds on **Shock isolation and travel limits** and prepares for **the unit capstone**. These connections matter because the motion predicted in one lesson becomes a forcing input or boundary condition in another. The algebra may look similar while the physical question changes: free response is not forced response, absolute displacement is not relative travel, and a modal natural frequency is not necessarily the frequency of peak operational vibration. Carry definitions of coordinates, units and assumptions forward; do not carry numerical values forward without checking whether the system has changed.

## Guided exercises and assessment

1. **Derivation:** Starting with a labeled free-body diagram or energy balance, derive or explain the screening relationship in this lesson. Show units and confirm at least one limiting case.
2. **Numerical sensitivity:** Recalculate the illustrative case with a 10% change in the parameter most likely to vary in service. Compare the relative change in output with the input change. State whether a linear approximation is justified.
3. **Measurement plan:** For “Four mounts support a 120 kg assembly that moves between rooms on a wheeled platform.”, choose sensor positions and quantities to measure, and specify a sampling or repeatability requirement. What observation would contradict the simple model?
4. **Model criticism:** Explain exactly why the following warning could overturn a proposed selection: Equal static shares require compatible center-of-mass location and mount stiffness; overturning and dynamics redistribute force.
5. **Design trade-off:** Compare two possible interventions, one changing inertia or stiffness and the other changing damping or forcing. Explain which practical requirement each intervention might worsen.
6. **Technical communication:** Write a short decision record separating a model-based prediction, an independent measurement, and a required acceptance condition. Explicitly label any unavailable evidence.

**Self-check:** Explain your result in physical words before looking again at the equation. If its magnitude or trend would surprise an engineer watching the mechanism move, review its coordinate, unit conversions, excitation type and validity limits. Do not use any draft value as an equipment setting without a complete review.
