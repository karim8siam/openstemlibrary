# U03-L01 — Force excitation and dynamic amplification

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 3: Harmonic Excitation and Resonance | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

## Learning objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to (1) construct a defensible simplified model of **force excitation and dynamic amplification**, (2) explain the cause-and-effect relationship between its parameters and the observable output, (3) reproduce the quantitative screening example without losing units, (4) identify a realistic failure of the model, and (5) propose a repeatable experiment or sensor strategy. The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

Harmonic force F0 cos(ωt) produces steady displacement amplitude X=(F0/k)/sqrt((1-r²)^2+(2ζr)^2), where r=ω/ω_n.

**Running example.** A 5 kg stage with k=5000 N/m, ζ=0.10 and F0=20 N is driven at r=1. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system. In particular, a displacement reported in millimeters can be either motion in an inertial frame or the difference between two moving points. The two quantities lead to different interpretations of isolation performance and dynamic stress.

A vibration model begins with inertia and a mechanism that transfers forces or energy. Inertia resists acceleration, elastic stiffness supplies a position-dependent restoring force, and mechanical damping removes energy through irreversible processes. A machine may also have forcing from unbalance, pressure pulses, electromagnetic torque, gear contact, road or floor input, or deliberate actuation. Do not include all these effects by default. Begin by isolating the mechanism suggested by the observed response, then test whether omitted effects matter at the operating point. If a linear model cannot reproduce amplitude, phase and frequency dependence together, the disagreement may identify additional physics, rather than an arithmetic problem.

The central interpretive question is not whether an equation has been solved, but whether its dependent variable corresponds to the requested decision. A natural frequency does not alone tell how large the motion will be; frequency of forcing and damping matter as well. Likewise, a reduction in displacement can coincide with a rise in acceleration if the frequency has changed. When comparing candidates, state whether you are minimizing motion, transmitted force, stress, sound, instrument error, fatigue or some weighted combination of those outcomes. These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** At r=1, X=(20/5000)/(2×0.1)=0.020 m.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution. Decide whether an amplitude is peak, peak-to-peak or RMS and maintain that convention throughout. Unless the input is a clean harmonic, conversions such as a_peak=ω²X_peak or v_RMS=v_peak/sqrt(2) should not be applied blindly. Where a model assumes a single mode or one-dimensional motion, describe the coordinate that stands in for the true three-dimensional structure.

A useful consistency check is to alter one parameter before making the final decision. Increasing mass at fixed stiffness lowers the natural frequency; increasing stiffness at fixed mass raises it. Damping generally decreases resonant amplification but can increase high-frequency force transmission. Increasing harmonic forcing frequency changes the inertial contribution quadratically. These tendencies apply only within the model that produced them: changes in geometry, preload, temperature, amplitude or joint contact can change mass distribution or stiffness at the same time. A model can be dimensionally correct and still physically wrong because it predicts a quantity no sensor actually measures.

## Worked engineering interpretation

Return to the case: A 5 kg stage with k=5000 N/m, ζ=0.10 and F0=20 N is driven at r=1. The screening result is useful for sizing a measurement range, identifying a suspected mode or testing whether an operating frequency overlaps a predicted response band. It is not a certification result. State the inputs you can actually measure, the ones you have merely assumed, and the likely interval of uncertainty. If two configurations differ by less than measurement variation, choosing the numerically better result is unjustified. For a machine with significant temperature changes, test cold and hot states; for a rotating machine, compare the speed sweep in both directions; for a flexible frame, check whether the fixture and mounting method influence the identified mode.

Introduce a second parameter set, changing one input by 10% while holding the others fixed. Predict the sign of the change before calculating. If the sign differs, identify whether the example crossed a resonance or a stability condition, used the wrong output definition, or violated the small-motion assumption. Record a baseline parameter table with source, unit, uncertainty and date. When the mathematical response is highly sensitive to a small change, refine the test plan before declaring that the first design works.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** Steady response requires transients to decay; large motion can invalidate linear stiffness. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum. If a simulation forecasts safe operation but measured vibration increases, stop escalating excitation and investigate the disagreement under controlled conditions. The responsibility to establish safe operating procedures, guards, machine access and acceptance limits belongs to qualified engineering personnel.

One way to diagnose discrepancy is to compare three distinct representations: a time trace, a spectrum or frequency-response curve, and a simple physical sketch of the expected motion. The time trace reveals clipping, impulses, drifting offsets and intermittent contact. The spectrum identifies periodic orders and broadband content but loses much time-localized information. The sketch tests whether the sensor direction can observe the hypothesized mode. A well-fitted numerical peak cannot establish a mechanism if the proposed mode shape is incompatible with the structure.

For measurement, **Collect both acceleration and force, then estimate receptance with sensor calibration.** Measure more than once under a documented load and speed; preserve settings and raw traces. A single amplitude without its frequency band, operating state, transducer orientation and convention is inadequate for comparison. Report model residuals where possible, and identify one datum that could prove the model false. The most useful conclusion may be that a simplified model is insufficient and a more complete test is required.

## Relations to nearby lessons

This lesson builds on **the previous unit foundation** and prepares for **Phase lag and complex compliance**. These connections matter because the motion predicted in one lesson becomes a forcing input or boundary condition in another. The algebra may look similar while the physical question changes: free response is not forced response, absolute displacement is not relative travel, and a modal natural frequency is not necessarily the frequency of peak operational vibration. Carry definitions of coordinates, units and assumptions forward; do not carry numerical values forward without checking whether the system has changed.

## Guided exercises and assessment

1. **Derivation:** Starting with a labeled free-body diagram or energy balance, derive or explain the screening relationship in this lesson. Show units and confirm at least one limiting case.
2. **Numerical sensitivity:** Recalculate the illustrative case with a 10% change in the parameter most likely to vary in service. Compare the relative change in output with the input change. State whether a linear approximation is justified.
3. **Measurement plan:** For “A 5 kg stage with k=5000 N/m, ζ=0.10 and F0=20 N is driven at r=1.”, choose sensor positions and quantities to measure, and specify a sampling or repeatability requirement. What observation would contradict the simple model?
4. **Model criticism:** Explain exactly why the following warning could overturn a proposed selection: Steady response requires transients to decay; large motion can invalidate linear stiffness.
5. **Design trade-off:** Compare two possible interventions, one changing inertia or stiffness and the other changing damping or forcing. Explain which practical requirement each intervention might worsen.
6. **Technical communication:** Write a short decision record separating a model-based prediction, an independent measurement, and a required acceptance condition. Explicitly label any unavailable evidence.

**Self-check:** Explain your result in physical words before looking again at the equation. If its magnitude or trend would surprise an engineer watching the mechanism move, review its coordinate, unit conversions, excitation type and validity limits. Do not use any draft value as an equipment setting without a complete review.

# U03-L02 — Phase lag and complex compliance

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 3: Harmonic Excitation and Resonance | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

For harmonic forcing, the phase lag is φ=atan2(2ζr,1-r²). Phase moves from near zero to near π through resonance.

**Running example.** A shaker frequency sweep changes whether displacement follows or opposes the applied force. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system.

When comparing candidates, state whether you are minimizing motion, transmitted force, stress, sound, instrument error, fatigue or some weighted combination of those outcomes. These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** At ζ=0.08 and r=1, φ=90°.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** Phase wrapping and inconsistent sensor polarity can make otherwise correct frequency-response data misleading. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum.

For measurement, **Apply a shared trigger and document the sign convention for force and displacement.** Measure more than once under a documented load and speed; preserve settings and raw traces.

Report model residuals where possible, and identify one datum that could prove the model false.

# U03-L03 — Half-power bandwidth

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 3: Harmonic Excitation and Resonance | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

## Learning objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to (1) construct a defensible simplified model of **half-power bandwidth**, (2) explain the cause-and-effect relationship between its parameters and the observable output, (3) reproduce the quantitative screening example without losing units, (4) identify a realistic failure of the model, and (5) propose a repeatable experiment or sensor strategy. The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

For lightly damped isolated modes, ζ is approximately Δf/(2f_n), where Δf spans the two half-power frequencies.

**Running example.** A vibration spectrum shows an isolated resonance near 30 Hz with a 3 Hz half-power width. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system.

**Screening calculation:** ζ≈3/(2×30)=0.050.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** The approximation fails for strongly coupled modes, high damping and nonlinear or coarse frequency scans. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum.

The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

A motor may pass through a resonant speed during acceleration; peak transient response depends on sweep rate and damping.

**Running example.** A test rig operates above resonance but must accelerate through the critical speed at startup. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** A 24 Hz resonance corresponds to 1440 cycles/min for a once-per-revolution forcing tone.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** Actual rotating-system critical speeds can change with bearing support, mode shape and thermal conditions.

# U03-L05 — Frequency-response testing

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering / Book 09 / Mechanical Vibrations**  
*Unit 3: Harmonic Excitation and Resonance | Unreviewed university-level educational manuscript.*

## Learning objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to (1) construct a defensible simplified model of **frequency-response testing**, (2) explain the cause-and-effect relationship between its parameters and the observable output, (3) reproduce the quantitative screening example without losing units, (4) identify a realistic failure of the model, and (5) propose a repeatable experiment or sensor strategy. The lesson is intentionally written around a physical decision, not merely a formula to memorize.

## Physical setting and mechanisms

A transfer-function estimate H(ω)=X(ω)/F(ω) should be paired with coherence, sensor limits and windowing decisions.

**Running example.** An impact hammer and accelerometer are used to identify a cabinet resonance. Start by naming what is *moving*, what imposes the *excitation*, and what establishes the motion reference. A support can be treated as fixed only if its motion is negligible over the frequency range of interest; if a floor, table, shaft or gearbox housing moves, it becomes part of the system. In particular, a displacement reported in millimeters can be either motion in an inertial frame or the difference between two moving points. The two quantities lead to different interpretations of isolation performance and dynamic stress.

A vibration model begins with inertia and a mechanism that transfers forces or energy. Inertia resists acceleration, elastic stiffness supplies a position-dependent restoring force, and mechanical damping removes energy through irreversible processes. A machine may also have forcing from unbalance, pressure pulses, electromagnetic torque, gear contact, road or floor input, or deliberate actuation. Do not include all these effects by default. Begin by isolating the mechanism suggested by the observed response, then test whether omitted effects matter at the operating point. If a linear model cannot reproduce amplitude, phase and frequency dependence together, the disagreement may identify additional physics, rather than an arithmetic problem.

The central interpretive question is not whether an equation has been solved, but whether its dependent variable corresponds to the requested decision. A natural frequency does not alone tell how large the motion will be; frequency of forcing and damping matter as well. Likewise, a reduction in displacement can coincide with a rise in acceleration if the frequency has changed. When comparing candidates, state whether you are minimizing motion, transmitted force, stress, sound, instrument error, fatigue or some weighted combination of those outcomes. These design objectives can conflict.

## Equation and derivation strategy

**Screening calculation:** Acceleration FRF is H_a=-(ω²)H_x for harmonic motion, assuming consistent signs.

To reproduce this calculation, first sketch a free-body diagram with a positive coordinate direction, then write the force or energy balance. Next substitute numerical inputs with units attached. Convert between frequency in hertz and angular frequency only through ω=2πf; convert rpm to Hz through f=rpm/60 for one event per revolution. Decide whether an amplitude is peak, peak-to-peak or RMS and maintain that convention throughout. Unless the input is a clean harmonic, conversions such as a_peak=ω²X_peak or v_RMS=v_peak/sqrt(2) should not be applied blindly. Where a model assumes a single mode or one-dimensional motion, describe the coordinate that stands in for the true three-dimensional structure.

A useful consistency check is to alter one parameter before making the final decision. Increasing mass at fixed stiffness lowers the natural frequency; increasing stiffness at fixed mass raises it. Damping generally decreases resonant amplification but can increase high-frequency force transmission. Increasing harmonic forcing frequency changes the inertial contribution quadratically. These tendencies apply only within the model that produced them: changes in geometry, preload, temperature, amplitude or joint contact can change mass distribution or stiffness at the same time. A model can be dimensionally correct and still physically wrong because it predicts a quantity no sensor actually measures.

## Worked engineering interpretation

Return to the case: An impact hammer and accelerometer are used to identify a cabinet resonance. The screening result is useful for sizing a measurement range, identifying a suspected mode or testing whether an operating frequency overlaps a predicted response band. It is not a certification result. State the inputs you can actually measure, the ones you have merely assumed, and the likely interval of uncertainty. If two configurations differ by less than measurement variation, choosing the numerically better result is unjustified. For a machine with significant temperature changes, test cold and hot states; for a rotating machine, compare the speed sweep in both directions; for a flexible frame, check whether the fixture and mounting method influence the identified mode.

Introduce a second parameter set, changing one input by 10% while holding the others fixed. Predict the sign of the change before calculating. If the sign differs, identify whether the example crossed a resonance or a stability condition, used the wrong output definition, or violated the small-motion assumption. Record a baseline parameter table with source, unit, uncertainty and date. When the mathematical response is highly sensitive to a small change, refine the test plan before declaring that the first design works.

## Boundaries, failure diagnosis and safety

**Important limitation:** Double integration to displacement amplifies low-frequency drift and bias; coherence alone does not ensure model accuracy. An industrial decision should not replace this qualification with a generic “allow a safety factor.” A factor cannot compensate for an incorrect vibration mode, unseen forcing order, missing contact state, defective sensor mounting or a wrong datum. If a simulation forecasts safe operation but measured vibration increases, stop escalating excitation and investigate the disagreement under controlled conditions. The responsibility to establish safe operating procedures, guards, machine access and acceptance limits belongs to qualified engineering personnel.

One way to diagnose discrepancy is to compare three distinct representations: a time trace, a spectrum or frequency-response curve, and a simple physical sketch of the expected motion. The time trace reveals clipping, impulses, drifting offsets and intermittent contact. The spectrum identifies periodic orders and broadband content but loses much time-localized information. The sketch tests whether the sensor direction can observe the hypothesized mode. A well-fitted numerical peak cannot establish a mechanism if the proposed mode shape is incompatible with the structure.

For measurement, **Repeat impacts at several locations and compare stable resonant peaks.** Measure more than once under a documented load and speed; preserve settings and raw traces. A single amplitude without its frequency band, operating state, transducer orientation and convention is inadequate for comparison. Report model residuals where possible, and identify one datum that could prove the model false. The most useful conclusion may be that a simplified model is insufficient and a more complete test is required.

## Relations to nearby lessons

This lesson builds on **Resonance crossing and run-up** and prepares for **the unit capstone**. These connections matter because the motion predicted in one lesson becomes a forcing input or boundary condition in another. The algebra may look similar while the physical question changes: free response is not forced response, absolute displacement is not relative travel, and a modal natural frequency is not necessarily the frequency of peak operational vibration. Carry definitions of coordinates, units and assumptions forward; do not carry numerical values forward without checking whether the system has changed.

## Guided exercises and assessment

1. **Derivation:** Starting with a labeled free-body diagram or energy balance, derive or explain the screening relationship in this lesson. Show units and confirm at least one limiting case.
2. **Numerical sensitivity:** Recalculate the illustrative case with a 10% change in the parameter most likely to vary in service. Compare the relative change in output with the input change. State whether a linear approximation is justified.
3. **Measurement plan:** For “An impact hammer and accelerometer are used to identify a cabinet resonance.”, choose sensor positions and quantities to measure, and specify a sampling or repeatability requirement. What observation would contradict the simple model?
4. **Model criticism:** Explain exactly why the following warning could overturn a proposed selection: Double integration to displacement amplifies low-frequency drift and bias; coherence alone does not ensure model accuracy.
5. **Design trade-off:** Compare two possible interventions, one changing inertia or stiffness and the other changing damping or forcing. Explain which practical requirement each intervention might worsen.
6. **Technical communication:** Write a short decision record separating a model-based prediction, an independent measurement, and a required acceptance condition. Explicitly label any unavailable evidence.

**Self-check:** Explain your result in physical words before looking again at the equation. If its magnitude or trend would surprise an engineer watching the mechanism move, review its coordinate, unit conversions, excitation type and validity limits. Do not use any draft value as an equipment setting without a complete review.
