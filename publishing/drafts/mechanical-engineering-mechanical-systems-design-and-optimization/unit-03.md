# U03-L01 — Optimization problem formulation

**Unit 3: Optimization Methods and Design Tradeoffs**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Decision variables must correspond to controllable choices: diameter, material, thickness, gear ratio or component catalog option. Specify objective sense, inequality direction, equality constraints and units. Non-smooth limits may require enumeration instead of calculus.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

The governing decision is linked to the unit's wider question: Design optimization asks which feasible decision vector gives the best defensible outcome. Feasibility conditions are not preferences. Multiobjective design typically produces a Pareto set rather than one uniquely correct answer, and ranking alternatives requires transparent priorities and sensitivity to uncertain weights. To make the relation operational, write every variable with units, the domain over which it is expected to be useful and the physical mechanism that might violate it. When using a supplied coefficient, say whether it came from a material test, a catalog, a standard, or a hypothetical classroom choice. Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `min_x f(x), subject to g(x) ≤ 0`

**Worked case.** Choose pipe diameter to minimize installed and energy cost while respecting a maximum allowable pressure drop. Distinguish continuous diameters used for exploration from manufactured nominal sizes used in purchase.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

An optimizer can choose a physically impossible tube wall thickness if minimum gauge, buckling and manufacturing constraints are missing.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location. The incoming load spectrum, corrosion exposure, calibration frequency and repair resources may be different. Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What is controlled?

State the decision variable, its allowed range, and which physical observations it can change. A variable that cannot be adjusted by the engineer is a disturbance or measured parameter; confusing the two makes the optimization unrealistic.

**Studio assignment.** Write a mathematical program for a motor mount, including stiffness and mass, then list every missing real-world constraint that could invalidate the optimum.

**Required confirmation.** Feasibility audit with catalog rounding and a verification calculation outside the optimizer.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Track interfaces where heat, stress, force, motion, pressure and dimensions interact. The correct limit often depends on the combined operating state rather than the maximum of one isolated variable. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 5. Exercises: calculation, design and criticism

1. **Definitions:** Explain **optimization problem formulation** to a technician who knows the equipment but has not studied the model. State the measurable event, required operating condition and one assumption that cannot be read directly from the output.
2. **Hand calculation:** Reproduce the worked case and its governing rule `min_x f(x), subject to g(x) ≤ 0` with all units and significant figures justified. Change one input by +10% and determine whether the direction of change is physically plausible.
3. **Boundary case:** Analyze the specific limitation: An optimizer can choose a physically impossible tube wall thickness if minimum gauge, buckling and manufacturing constraints are missing. Explain which additional calculation, test or design constraint is required and why a single generic safety factor cannot solve the missing-physics problem.
4. **Alternative:** Write a mathematical program for a motor mount, including stiffness and mass, then list every missing real-world constraint that could invalidate the optimum. Propose a second feasible mechanism or component, not merely a different numerical setting of the original choice. Evaluate manufacturing and maintenance implications.
5. **Evidence:** Feasibility audit with catalog rounding and a verification calculation outside the optimizer. Prepare a small table of what would be measured, which instrument would be used, what uncertainty could dominate and whether the result would verify a requirement or validate intended use.

**Instructor checkpoint A.** An answer that repeats the formula without identifying the operational boundary is incomplete. The student's result must have consistent units and a clear physical sign. If the output is expressed as a ratio or probability, explain its numerical range and whether independence assumptions apply. If an optimization is involved, a design that violates a hard constraint is rejected even if its objective is lower.

**Instructor checkpoint B.** Students should distinguish a calculated output from physical evidence. Strong submissions show an independent check, a sensitivity comparison, a plausible counterexample and an actionable test plan. A poor submission uses extra decimal places, repeated simulations, or an appealing chart to imply accuracy that the inputs do not support. A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **optimization problem formulation** is related to **manufacturing, supply chain and sustainable design**. A design that cannot be made, inspected, acquired, repaired or recycled at the expected scale is incomplete. Manufacturing decisions control achievable tolerances, surface integrity, defect distributions, lead times and unit economics. Environmental comparisons must use a consistent functional unit and lifecycle boundary. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U03-L02 — Sensitivity and local derivatives

**Unit 3: Optimization Methods and Design Tradeoffs**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Sensitivity quantifies how an output changes with one input, but it is not a substitute for global uncertainty assessment. Normalize derivatives when comparing quantities with different units, and test whether the trend reverses around a constraint or discontinuity.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `S_x = (x/y)(∂y/∂x)`

**Worked case.** For shaft bending stiffness EI, increasing diameter by 5% changes second moment of area roughly by 1.05^4−1 ≈ 21.6% for a solid round section at fixed material. It also increases mass and may change packaging.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Local derivatives near a hard contact transition can be unstable or misleading. Coupled input changes require total rather than partial derivatives.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location. The incoming load spectrum, corrosion exposure, calibration frequency and repair resources may be different. Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What is conserved?

Start by tracing mass, force, energy or information through the studied boundary. Write down any neglected source, loss or interface. When a numerical output appears to violate a conservation statement, inspect boundary definitions before changing the data.

**Studio assignment.** Rank four input uncertainties by their estimated effect on a design margin, then confirm with a finite-difference calculation.

**Required confirmation.** Finite-difference step study and a record of correlated inputs.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Evaluate dynamic response using an identified inertia, stiffness, damping and actuator torque-speed curve. Verify sensing and sampling delays, saturations, and the behavior of the machine after power interruption. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **sensitivity and local derivatives** is related to **uncertainty, robustness, testing and reliability**. Nominal performance is not robust performance. Uncertain loading, material properties, wear, manufacturing variation and model inadequacy produce distributions or bounded envelopes. Verification asks whether the calculation or implementation is correct; validation asks whether the model represents the intended reality. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U03-L03 — Constrained optimization and multipliers

**Unit 3: Optimization Methods and Design Tradeoffs**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

A constrained optimum frequently lies on an active physical limit. The shadow-price interpretation of a Lagrange multiplier is local and only meaningful under the method assumptions and an identifiable optimal solution.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

The governing decision is linked to the unit's wider question: Design optimization asks which feasible decision vector gives the best defensible outcome. Feasibility conditions are not preferences.

Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `L(x,λ)=f(x)+λg(x)`

**Worked case.** Minimize beam mass subject to a maximum deflection. At the lightest feasible section, the stiffness requirement is usually active; relaxing deflection by a small amount may allow a lighter beam.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Nonconvex landscapes and discrete catalog sizes may make local optimality unreliable. A numerical solver status message is not a design certificate.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — Where are the limits?

Report physical operating limits, catalog limits and mandated safeguards separately. A design which fails an essential condition is not acceptable just because its average objective value is attractive.

**Studio assignment.** Compare a hand-enumerated set of five beam sections with a continuous optimization and explain any disagreement.

**Required confirmation.** KKT-condition check where applicable and final catalog-based analysis.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Consider the entire manufacturing route and the support work needed during the product life. Use consistent measurements for process yield, geometry, inspection and service time. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **constrained optimization and multipliers** is related to **integrated capstone and engineering decision-making**. System design culminates in traceable evidence and an honest decision under constraints. A useful engineering dossier ties stakeholder needs to functional architecture, engineering analysis, cost, verification, failure controls, manufacturing and eventual disposition. Unresolved risk is an outcome to report, not a number to conceal. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U03-L04 — Pareto fronts and multiobjective decisions

**Unit 3: Optimization Methods and Design Tradeoffs**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Mass, cost, energy and maintainability may conflict. A Pareto-dominated design is inferior on all considered objectives, but Pareto efficiency does not prove it is good or safe. Decision priorities should be explicit and tested for changes.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `A dominates B if no worse in every objective and better in ≥1`

**Worked case.** Three alternatives cost 80, 100 and 120 units and weigh 12, 9 and 11 kg respectively. The last is dominated by the middle because it is both heavier and more expensive. The other two express a real tradeoff.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Changing units or arbitrary weighting can change score-based rankings. Hard safety conditions remain constraints, never optional objectives.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What is the evidence?

Maintain raw measurements, instrument calibration data, model input files and revision identifiers. An output graph without provenance cannot be independently reconstructed and should not serve as an engineering acceptance record.

**Studio assignment.** Calculate the nondominated set for six candidate housings and prepare a choice rationale under two stakeholder preference scenarios.

**Required confirmation.** Pareto plot, consistent functional unit and stakeholder sign-off on final priorities.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Represent measured scatter, uncertainty in model parameters and omitted mechanisms separately. Choose verification evidence that addresses the highest-consequence failure modes, not just the easiest measurements. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 5. Exercises: calculation, design and criticism

1. **Definitions:** Explain **pareto fronts and multiobjective decisions** to a technician who knows the equipment but has not studied the model. State the measurable event, required operating condition and one assumption that cannot be read directly from the output.
2. **Hand calculation:** Reproduce the worked case and its governing rule `A dominates B if no worse in every objective and better in ≥1` with all units and significant figures justified. Change one input by +10% and determine whether the direction of change is physically plausible.

A poor submission uses extra decimal places, repeated simulations, or an appealing chart to imply accuracy that the inputs do not support. A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **pareto fronts and multiobjective decisions** is related to **engineering requirements and system architecture**. A mechanical system is an arrangement of components that jointly deliver a function within physical, financial and regulatory limits. Requirements must state observable performance, mission, environment, boundaries and evidence of acceptance. A specification without a test method cannot serve as a contract between customer, designer and verifier. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U03-L05 — Design of experiments and optimization validation

**Unit 3: Optimization Methods and Design Tradeoffs**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

A structured experiment estimates main effects, interactions and process noise more efficiently than uncontrolled one-factor trials. Randomization and repeat measurements help distinguish causal effects from test sequence drift.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

The governing decision is linked to the unit's wider question: Design optimization asks which feasible decision vector gives the best defensible outcome. Feasibility conditions are not preferences. Multiobjective design typically produces a Pareto set rather than one uniquely correct answer, and ranking alternatives requires transparent priorities and sensitivity to uncertain weights. To make the relation operational, write every variable with units, the domain over which it is expected to be useful and the physical mechanism that might violate it. When using a supplied coefficient, say whether it came from a material test, a catalog, a standard, or a hypothetical classroom choice. Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `Response = β0 + βA A + βB B + βAB AB + ε`

**Worked case.** For a cooling plate, vary channel width and flow rate at two levels each, repeat selected runs and examine whether the effect of width depends on the flow rate. Four corner runs alone give little information about curvature.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Changing a fixture mid-experiment creates confounding. A good fit to a factorial design does not guarantee optimum between tested levels.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location. The incoming load spectrum, corrosion exposure, calibration frequency and repair resources may be different. Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What could reverse the decision?

Identify the single uncertain parameter most likely to change the preferred alternative. Design a low-risk test that would measure it and record what evidence would justify changing the recommendation.

**Studio assignment.** Design a safe two-factor bench test and state which observations would make you add a center point or expand the parameter range.

**Required confirmation.** Raw test matrix, randomized order, calibration record and estimated repeatability.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Present a traceable technical argument that allows another engineer to reconstruct the design choice. List rejected concepts, open issues, physical test evidence, planned maintenance and permitted operating limits. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 5. Exercises: calculation, design and criticism

1. **Definitions:** Explain **design of experiments and optimization validation** to a technician who knows the equipment but has not studied the model. State the measurable event, required operating condition and one assumption that cannot be read directly from the output.
2. **Hand calculation:** Reproduce the worked case and its governing rule `Response = β0 + βA A + βB B + βAB AB + ε` with all units and significant figures justified. Change one input by +10% and determine whether the direction of change is physically plausible.
3. **Boundary case:** Analyze the specific limitation: Changing a fixture mid-experiment creates confounding. A good fit to a factorial design does not guarantee optimum between tested levels. Explain which additional calculation, test or design constraint is required and why a single generic safety factor cannot solve the missing-physics problem.
4. **Alternative:** Design a safe two-factor bench test and state which observations would make you add a center point or expand the parameter range. Propose a second feasible mechanism or component, not merely a different numerical setting of the original choice. Evaluate manufacturing and maintenance implications.
5. **Evidence:** Raw test matrix, randomized order, calibration record and estimated repeatability. Prepare a small table of what would be measured, which instrument would be used, what uncertainty could dominate and whether the result would verify a requirement or validate intended use.

**Instructor checkpoint A.** An answer that repeats the formula without identifying the operational boundary is incomplete. The student's result must have consistent units and a clear physical sign. If the output is expressed as a ratio or probability, explain its numerical range and whether independence assumptions apply. If an optimization is involved, a design that violates a hard constraint is rejected even if its objective is lower.

**Instructor checkpoint B.** Students should distinguish a calculated output from physical evidence. Strong submissions show an independent check, a sensitivity comparison, a plausible counterexample and an actionable test plan. A poor submission uses extra decimal places, repeated simulations, or an appealing chart to imply accuracy that the inputs do not support. A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **design of experiments and optimization validation** is related to **physics-based modeling and digital engineering**. A useful model states assumptions, state variables, boundary conditions, conservation relations and applicable time scale. A model is not a digital twin merely because it has a dashboard. Its predictive usefulness rests on calibration, identification and comparison with measurements independent of fitting data. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.
