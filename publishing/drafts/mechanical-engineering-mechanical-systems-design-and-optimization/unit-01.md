## Unit Overview & Physical Foundations

This comprehensive university textbook unit covers the theoretical framework, physical modeling, mathematical governing equations, and engineering applications of **Engineering Requirements and System Architecture**.

# U01-L01 — Stakeholder needs and functions

**Unit 1: Engineering Requirements and System Architecture**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Separate user activities from physical functions. A warehouse operator wants throughput and low injury risk, while a service technician needs access to the drive without disturbing guarding. Translate both into functions before choosing actuators.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

The governing decision is linked to the unit's wider question: A mechanical system is an arrangement of components that jointly deliver a function within physical, financial and regulatory limits. Requirements must state observable performance, mission, environment, boundaries and evidence of acceptance. A specification without a test method cannot serve as a contract between customer, designer and verifier. To make the relation operational, write every variable with units, the domain over which it is expected to be useful and the physical mechanism that might violate it. When using a supplied coefficient, say whether it came from a material test, a catalog, a standard, or a hypothetical classroom choice. Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `Function = action + object + measurable outcome`

**Worked case.** For a transfer module, write: move a 15 kg package by 0.8 m within 2.0 s, with end-position error no greater than 2 mm, without exposing a pinch point. Distinguish this statement from a design suggestion such as use a belt drive.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Specifying a particular actuator too early locks in a solution, suppresses alternatives and can omit cleaning, inspection and emergency recovery requirements.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location. The incoming load spectrum, corrosion exposure, calibration frequency and repair resources may be different. Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What is controlled?

State the decision variable, its allowed range, and which physical observations it can change. A variable that cannot be adjusted by the engineer is a disturbance or measured parameter; confusing the two makes the optimization unrealistic.

**Studio assignment.** Interview three users and convert their narratives into testable operating cases. Document conflicts rather than averaging requirements blindly.

**Required confirmation.** Observation of users, signed need statements and an acceptance test aligned to the function.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Start with the system boundary and distinguish conservation equations from fitted correlations. Identify what inputs are measured, taken from vendor data or chosen for teaching. Do not claim that a model represents the plant until a separate measurement comparison has been made. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 5. Exercises: calculation, design and criticism

1. **Definitions:** Explain **stakeholder needs and functions** to a technician who knows the equipment but has not studied the model. State the measurable event, required operating condition and one assumption that cannot be read directly from the output.
2. **Hand calculation:** Reproduce the worked case and its governing rule `Function = action + object + measurable outcome` with all units and significant figures justified. Change one input by +10% and determine whether the direction of change is physically plausible.
3. **Boundary case:** Analyze the specific limitation: Specifying a particular actuator too early locks in a solution, suppresses alternatives and can omit cleaning, inspection and emergency recovery requirements. Explain which additional calculation, test or design constraint is required and why a single generic safety factor cannot solve the missing-physics problem.
4. **Alternative:** Interview three users and convert their narratives into testable operating cases. Document conflicts rather than averaging requirements blindly. Propose a second feasible mechanism or component, not merely a different numerical setting of the original choice. Evaluate manufacturing and maintenance implications.
5. **Evidence:** Observation of users, signed need statements and an acceptance test aligned to the function. Prepare a small table of what would be measured, which instrument would be used, what uncertainty could dominate and whether the result would verify a requirement or validate intended use.

**Instructor checkpoint A.** An answer that repeats the formula without identifying the operational boundary is incomplete. The student's result must have consistent units and a clear physical sign. If the output is expressed as a ratio or probability, explain its numerical range and whether independence assumptions apply. If an optimization is involved, a design that violates a hard constraint is rejected even if its objective is lower.

**Instructor checkpoint B.** Students should distinguish a calculated output from physical evidence. Strong submissions show an independent check, a sensitivity comparison, a plausible counterexample and an actionable test plan. A poor submission uses extra decimal places, repeated simulations, or an appealing chart to imply accuracy that the inputs do not support. A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **stakeholder needs and functions** is related to **structural, thermal and fluid co-design**. Mechanical design is coupled: increasing stiffness can raise mass; reducing friction changes heat generation; additional insulation changes expansion and packaging. Sequential discipline-by-discipline optimization often shifts a problem to another subsystem. Co-design evaluates physical interfaces and operating envelopes. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U01-L02 — Measurable requirements and traceability

**Unit 1: Engineering Requirements and System Architecture**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Every requirement should be feasible, verifiable and free of solution bias where possible. Organize functions, performance constraints, interfaces, safety obligations and documentation requirements. Assign identifiers that survive revisions.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `Requirement → evidence → disposition`

**Worked case.** A requirement of “quiet operation” is unverifiable. Replace it with sound-pressure level measured under a specified load, distance, room condition, frequency weighting and declared instrument uncertainty.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Measurements taken under one ambient condition may not verify the entire operating envelope, even if they technically meet a vague number.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location.

Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What is conserved?

Start by tracing mass, force, energy or information through the studied boundary. Write down any neglected source, loss or interface. When a numerical output appears to violate a conservation statement, inspect boundary definitions before changing the data.

**Studio assignment.** Create 12 requirements for the workstation. Link each to analysis, inspection, demonstration or test and name a person empowered to approve discrepancies.

**Required confirmation.** Traceability matrix with requirement ID, method, threshold, data file, revision and pass/fail rationale.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Write explicit hard constraints and evaluate them before comparing objective values. Use a common functional unit across alternatives. When uncertainty is large, quantify how a small adjustment in an estimated input alters the selected option. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **measurable requirements and traceability** is related to **dynamics, control and mechatronic integration**. Moving mechanisms must satisfy kinematics, force and torque limits, transient control behavior and safety response. Sensor filtering introduces phase delay; actuator limits break linear assumptions. The selected mechanical transmission affects control bandwidth, heat and serviceability, so integration must be concurrent. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U01-L03 — Functional decomposition and interfaces

**Unit 1: Engineering Requirements and System Architecture**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Break complex functions into energy, material, signal and information flows. Mechanical, electrical and software boundaries often produce failure modes at interfaces rather than within individual components. State which team owns each interface.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `System = subsystems + coupling + environment`

**Worked case.** Map input electrical power through controller, motor, transmission and load. Include heat rejection, shaft feedback and operator commands. An electrical connector that fits physically may still be incompatible in voltage or signal timing.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Functional diagrams that omit maintenance state and fault response cannot explain service behavior. Redundancy is illusory if both branches depend on the same supply.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — Where are the limits?

Report physical operating limits, catalog limits and mandated safeguards separately. A design which fails an essential condition is not acceptable just because its average objective value is attractive.

**Studio assignment.** Draw three architecture alternatives and mark energy flow, control flow, shared utilities and the conditions that disable each function.

**Required confirmation.** Numbered interface control document checked by both suppliers and the integration engineer.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Track interfaces where heat, stress, force, motion, pressure and dimensions interact. The correct limit often depends on the combined operating state rather than the maximum of one isolated variable. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **functional decomposition and interfaces** is related to **manufacturing, supply chain and sustainable design**. A design that cannot be made, inspected, acquired, repaired or recycled at the expected scale is incomplete. Manufacturing decisions control achievable tolerances, surface integrity, defect distributions, lead times and unit economics. Environmental comparisons must use a consistent functional unit and lifecycle boundary. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

# U01-L04 — Operating envelopes and load cases

**Unit 1: Engineering Requirements and System Architecture**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

One nominal design point rarely controls strength, energy or reliability. Distinguish commissioning, startup, reversal, maximum payload, stall, fault, transport and long-term wear conditions. Evaluate credible combinations instead of multiplying every extreme independently.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

The governing decision is linked to the unit's wider question: A mechanical system is an arrangement of components that jointly deliver a function within physical, financial and regulatory limits. Requirements must state observable performance, mission, environment, boundaries and evidence of acceptance. A specification without a test method cannot serve as a contract between customer, designer and verifier. To make the relation operational, write every variable with units, the domain over which it is expected to be useful and the physical mechanism that might violate it. When using a supplied coefficient, say whether it came from a material test, a catalog, a standard, or a hypothetical classroom choice. Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `Design case = load × state × environment`

**Worked case.** A shaft sees 8 N·m steady torque but 25 N·m during acceleration; sizing from steady torque alone underestimates peak stress. An overload clutch may be required if a jam creates still higher torque.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

A conservative design factor does not compensate for an unrecognized load case. Ignoring operator misuse and thermal startup may create unexpected brittle or clearance failures.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location. The incoming load spectrum, corrosion exposure, calibration frequency and repair resources may be different. Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What is the evidence?

Maintain raw measurements, instrument calibration data, model input files and revision identifiers. An output graph without provenance cannot be independently reconstructed and should not serve as an engineering acceptance record.

**Studio assignment.** Construct a load-case matrix with frequency, consequence, input sources and applicable design limit for the workstation.

**Required confirmation.** Measured or independently calculated peak load history plus signed load-case definition.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Evaluate dynamic response using an identified inertia, stiffness, damping and actuator torque-speed curve. Verify sensing and sampling delays, saturations, and the behavior of the machine after power interruption. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 5. Exercises: calculation, design and criticism

1. **Definitions:** Explain **operating envelopes and load cases** to a technician who knows the equipment but has not studied the model. State the measurable event, required operating condition and one assumption that cannot be read directly from the output.

A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **operating envelopes and load cases** is related to **uncertainty, robustness, testing and reliability**. Nominal performance is not robust performance. Uncertain loading, material properties, wear, manufacturing variation and model inadequacy produce distributions or bounded envelopes. Verification asks whether the calculation or implementation is correct; validation asks whether the model represents the intended reality. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.

# U01-L05 — Concept generation and architecture selection

**Unit 1: Engineering Requirements and System Architecture**  
**Purpose.** Evaluate one real design decision in the context of an integrated mechanical system. Students should be able to explain the physics, run a bounded calculation, test its assumptions and prepare a defensible design record.

## 1. Physical meaning and engineering relevance

Divergent concept generation creates alternatives before detailed calculation. Compare fundamental physical principles—screw, belt, rack, hydraulic cylinder—rather than cosmetic variants of one machine. Apply hard feasibility gates before weighted preference scores.

A good engineering claim starts from the exact outcome being sought and a stated operational setting. In this lesson, explain what happens during commissioning, steady operation, abnormal operation and normal service. A variable that looks constant in a laboratory exercise may change dramatically when equipment ages or moves between sites. A drawing alone cannot show every thermal, mechanical and control dependency; record interfaces and operating sequences as well. Treat the word **system** as a boundary containing components, people, controls and environmental interactions, not simply a list of purchased items.

The governing decision is linked to the unit's wider question: A mechanical system is an arrangement of components that jointly deliver a function within physical, financial and regulatory limits. Requirements must state observable performance, mission, environment, boundaries and evidence of acceptance. A specification without a test method cannot serve as a contract between customer, designer and verifier. To make the relation operational, write every variable with units, the domain over which it is expected to be useful and the physical mechanism that might violate it. When using a supplied coefficient, say whether it came from a material test, a catalog, a standard, or a hypothetical classroom choice. Do not silently combine catalog ratings at different temperatures or duty cycles. If a concept depends on an uncertain input, use its plausible interval rather than only a best-looking estimate.

## 2. Governing relation and useful calculation

**Core relation or design rule:** `Feasible if g_i(x) ≤ 0 for each hard constraint`

**Worked case.** Compare a screw lift and pneumatic lift for repeatable positioning. The pneumatic option may be lighter but requires an air system and holding protection during supply loss. The screw option may self-lock only under specific friction assumptions.

The first check is dimensional: if the symbols represent different physical dimensions, convert to a common SI basis before evaluating. The second check is one limiting case: set a load to zero, make the design very stiff, or let an efficiency approach unity—whichever is physically relevant—and ask if the predicted direction makes sense. The third check is to estimate the size of an ignored term. A compact hand calculation is valuable because it can expose a reversed ratio or a misplaced conversion factor that would otherwise pass through a spreadsheet unnoticed.

Convert the worked case into a design memo: state the known inputs, unknown output, assumptions, calculation, units and consequence of crossing the limit. Make two alternative estimates, one at a favorable operating point and one at a credible adverse point. Explain why the apparent improvement may not translate into a better total system. The correct comparison uses the same function, service life and boundary for each alternative rather than comparing one design at peak efficiency with another at average duty.

## 3. Scope, counterexample and failure conditions

Weighting safety as a preference allows poor safeguards to be traded against cost. A concept that violates a legal constraint is removed, not scored.

A calculation is only as good as its assumed configuration. Ask whether the actual mechanism is linear, whether geometry remains unchanged, whether a temperature-dependent property was treated as fixed, and whether contact, vibration or actuator saturation could introduce a discontinuity. If the model ignores an effect because it appears small, report the evidence supporting that decision. Quantification is not a substitute for identifying hazards: an attractive weighted objective cannot excuse an unverified guard, protection feature, pressure boundary or emergency stop.

A counterexample helps establish the scope. Imagine the original design moved from a controlled teaching bench to a dirty or wet industrial location. The incoming load spectrum, corrosion exposure, calibration frequency and repair resources may be different. Name at least one parameter from the equation that remains meaningful and one omitted mechanism that becomes important. Explain how the design review would change if that mechanism is plausible. Record any consequence whose acceptability must be judged by a competent safety professional rather than inferred from a classroom equation.

## 4. Practical investigation — What could reverse the decision?

Identify the single uncertain parameter most likely to change the preferred alternative. Design a low-risk test that would measure it and record what evidence would justify changing the recommendation.

**Studio assignment.** Prepare three concepts with predicted accuracy, maintenance access, energy consumption and supplier availability; document one reason each might fail.

**Required confirmation.** A concept review recording unmet constraints, decisive tests and dissenting technical concerns.

Build a reproducible notebook for this assignment. Include a sketch or diagram, table of known quantities with units, a physical basis for each relationship, and a separate list of facts that are merely assumed. Perform the calculation with independent arithmetic. If testing is proposed, explain where the sensors go and how their calibration and resolution affect the result. State what data would falsify the current design hypothesis; do not propose only measurements that could support it. Keep original data rather than overwriting it when outliers or transcription errors are discovered.

For this particular case, apply the following broader check: Consider the entire manufacturing route and the support work needed during the product life. Use consistent measurements for process yield, geometry, inspection and service time. This guards against optimizing one metric while overlooking a coupled physical constraint. Report a design alternative in which the selected performance improves while some other important objective worsens. That alternative may still be appropriate, but the trade must be transparent and tied to stakeholder priorities. Before deciding, check whether the new configuration requires another supplier capability study, additional inspection or a revised safety analysis.

## 5. Exercises: calculation, design and criticism

1. **Definitions:** Explain **concept generation and architecture selection** to a technician who knows the equipment but has not studied the model. State the measurable event, required operating condition and one assumption that cannot be read directly from the output.
2. **Hand calculation:** Reproduce the worked case and its governing rule `Feasible if g_i(x) ≤ 0 for each hard constraint` with all units and significant figures justified. Change one input by +10% and determine whether the direction of change is physically plausible.
3. **Boundary case:** Analyze the specific limitation: Weighting safety as a preference allows poor safeguards to be traded against cost. A concept that violates a legal constraint is removed, not scored. Explain which additional calculation, test or design constraint is required and why a single generic safety factor cannot solve the missing-physics problem.
4. **Alternative:** Prepare three concepts with predicted accuracy, maintenance access, energy consumption and supplier availability; document one reason each might fail. Propose a second feasible mechanism or component, not merely a different numerical setting of the original choice. Evaluate manufacturing and maintenance implications.
5. **Evidence:** A concept review recording unmet constraints, decisive tests and dissenting technical concerns. Prepare a small table of what would be measured, which instrument would be used, what uncertainty could dominate and whether the result would verify a requirement or validate intended use.

**Instructor checkpoint A.** An answer that repeats the formula without identifying the operational boundary is incomplete. The student's result must have consistent units and a clear physical sign. If the output is expressed as a ratio or probability, explain its numerical range and whether independence assumptions apply. If an optimization is involved, a design that violates a hard constraint is rejected even if its objective is lower.

**Instructor checkpoint B.** Students should distinguish a calculated output from physical evidence. Strong submissions show an independent check, a sensitivity comparison, a plausible counterexample and an actionable test plan. A poor submission uses extra decimal places, repeated simulations, or an appealing chart to imply accuracy that the inputs do not support. A recommendation is not complete without a limitation and a named action to reduce the largest consequential uncertainty.

## 6. Integration with other mechanical disciplines

The design decision in **concept generation and architecture selection** is related to **integrated capstone and engineering decision-making**. System design culminates in traceable evidence and an honest decision under constraints. A useful engineering dossier ties stakeholder needs to functional architecture, engineering analysis, cost, verification, failure controls, manufacturing and eventual disposition. Unresolved risk is an outcome to report, not a number to conceal. Think about what information must pass between those two engineering teams and whether the transfer occurs as a load case, geometric tolerance, material property, signal, cost scenario or acceptance test. An interface that lacks an owner may survive several design reviews without being checked. In a final integration meeting, require each assumption to have an identified source and a planned verification activity; record deviations explicitly.

**Engineering notebook output:** One independent arithmetic check, one alternative architecture, one requirement-to-evidence row, one uncertainty statement, and one open risk item to carry into the unit capstone.
