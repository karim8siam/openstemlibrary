# Unit 8: Gas Mixtures, Psychrometrics, and Reactive Systems

# Unit 8, Lesson 1 — Moist air and psychrometric properties

**Learning goals.** Explain the physical meaning of the stated relationship; use the example to reconstruct a verifiable answer; identify at least two model limitations; and propose an independent check.

## 1. Physical question and conceptual model

Air-conditioning calculations track dry-air mass separately from water vapor mass. Humidity ratio w is vapor mass per dry-air mass. Relative humidity compares vapor partial pressure with saturation vapor pressure at the same dry-bulb temperature, not with total air pressure. Cooling below the dew point can condense water and alter sensible and latent heat balances.


**Professional use.** Use a consistent psychrometric basis and locate the dew point before estimating condensation. Avoid jumping from a property value to a performance guarantee: the former describes an assumed state, and the latter depends on losses, materials, reliability and operating limits.

## 2. Build the mathematical relationship

**Governing statement:** `w=0.62198 p_v/(p−p_v)`.


**Model qualification.** The equation is meaningful only when its state and process assumptions are satisfied. Some equations are conservation balances that remain exact for their declared boundary; others are constitutive approximations, such as an ideal-gas relation, a constant heat capacity or an isentropic reference process. Determine which category this statement belongs to. Explain whether extra phenomena such as a moving boundary, leakage, heat loss, multiphase conditions, kinetic energy, electrical work or chemical reaction would add terms or require a different property source. If the process is transient, ask whether an accumulation term is missing.

## 3. Worked teaching example

At p=101.325 kPa and vapor partial pressure p_v=2.0 kPa, humidity ratio is about 0.01252 kg/kg dry air.


**Interpretive check.** Does the result increase or decrease when the principal driving condition becomes stronger? Does the prediction approach a sensible limit when the temperature difference, flow rate, state change or relevant force approaches zero? Such limiting tests are not substitutes for a measurement, but they are effective at rejecting a broken model before the expensive stage of building apparatus or selecting equipment.

## 4. Failure analysis and engineering judgement

**A tempting but incorrect shortcut:** Treating relative humidity percentage as identical to humidity ratio.

Investigate what this shortcut assumes about the device or material. Predict whether it would overstate useful work, misstate the phase, hide a heat leak or suppress a needed transport term. Estimate the direction of the bias before estimating its size. A numerical calculation that conserves energy can still violate the second law; similarly, a temperature prediction can be inconsistent with phase equilibrium. Test both conservation and state feasibility. Where the model is an ideal upper or lower bound, identify which side of the bound a real machine should occupy under comparable conditions.

**Engineering context.** Use a consistent psychrometric basis and locate the dew point before estimating condensation. A useful report would specify the relevant operating range, which properties are tabulated or calculated, and which assumptions are supported by evidence. It would not claim that an attractive textbook efficiency, coefficient of performance or output power proves achievable production performance.

## 5. Verification and measurement protocol

Design a simple check of **moist air and psychrometric properties**. Specify a control volume or control mass, boundary conditions, primary observations and sampling interval. Report whether the observation is direct (temperature, mass, voltage, volumetric flow), indirectly inferred (enthalpy, dryness fraction, exergy), or fitted from an empirical relation. Distinguish repeatability from model validity: a repeatable sensor can be wrongly calibrated, and a perfectly reproducible computer program can implement the wrong equation. Identify one test in which the idealization should perform reasonably, and a second test where a named assumption may break down. If you use fluid property tables or software, record its provenance, units, reference state and interpolation method.


## 6. Questions and answer criteria

**Exercise A — Reconstruct.** Reproduce the stated worked example with symbols, units and at least one limiting check. *Answer criterion:* obtain the stated value within rounding and explain each term in `w=0.62198 p_v/(p−p_v)`.

**Exercise B — Predict.** Select one physically independent input, change it by 10%, and predict the response before calculation. *Answer criterion:* state whether a linear, reciprocal, logarithmic or state-dependent relationship is being used, and explain why it is valid over the selected interval.

**Exercise C — Diagnose.** Evaluate this proposed shortcut: "Treating relative humidity percentage as identical to humidity ratio." *Answer criterion:* identify the missing assumption, specify a condition where the shortcut fails, and propose one measurement or alternate model that would expose the error.

## 7. Extended case and reproducible handover

Return to the **building heat-recovery retrofit** case that motivates this unit. The choice compares sensible and latent heating, economics and safety. Use this lesson's principle to create a two-column comparison between a minimal classroom calculation and a safer engineering estimate. The classroom side should contain only quantities supported by the basic model; the engineering side should add condensation, fouling, indoor air quality, maintenance and code compliance. For each added quantity, say whether it is known, must be measured, can be estimated from trustworthy property data, or is impossible to infer from the current information. Where a value is unknown, retain a symbol or range instead of fabricating a precise number.


## 8. Closing self-test

Without viewing your notes, explain why the same physical device can be modeled with different boundaries, which quantities change accordingly and which conservation principles remain unchanged. Explain the relationship in your own words before quoting its symbols. If you cannot distinguish a property from a path function, or theoretical limit from verified behavior, revisit the model formulation rather than memorizing the numerical answer.

# Unit 8, Lesson 2 — Combustion stoichiometry and energy release

**Learning goals.** Explain the physical meaning of the stated relationship; use the example to reconstruct a verifiable answer; identify at least two model limitations; and propose an independent check.

## 1. Physical question and conceptual model

Combustion analysis starts by balancing atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. For complete methane combustion, CH4+2O2→CO2+2H2O. Fuel-air ratio, excess air, product temperature and heat losses influence efficiency. Energy release depends on heating-value convention and product-water phase.


**Professional use.** Track unburned fuel, CO, NOx, moisture and equipment controls in real combustion systems. Avoid jumping from a property value to a performance guarantee: the former describes an assumed state, and the latter depends on losses, materials, reliability and operating limits.

## 2. Build the mathematical relationship

**Governing statement:** `CH4+2O2→CO2+2H2O`.


**Model qualification.** The equation is meaningful only when its state and process assumptions are satisfied. Some equations are conservation balances that remain exact for their declared boundary; others are constitutive approximations, such as an ideal-gas relation, a constant heat capacity or an isentropic reference process. Determine which category this statement belongs to. Explain whether extra phenomena such as a moving boundary, leakage, heat loss, multiphase conditions, kinetic energy, electrical work or chemical reaction would add terms or require a different property source. If the process is transient, ask whether an accumulation term is missing.

## 3. Worked teaching example

One kmol of completely burned methane generates one kmol of CO2; using molar masses 16 and 44 kg/kmol gives 2.75 kg CO2 per kg methane.


**Interpretive check.** Does the result increase or decrease when the principal driving condition becomes stronger? Does the prediction approach a sensible limit when the temperature difference, flow rate, state change or relevant force approaches zero? Such limiting tests are not substitutes for a measurement, but they are effective at rejecting a broken model before the expensive stage of building apparatus or selecting equipment.

## 4. Failure analysis and engineering judgement

**A tempting but incorrect shortcut:** Reporting this ideal reaction ratio as the full lifecycle greenhouse footprint of methane use.

Investigate what this shortcut assumes about the device or material. Predict whether it would overstate useful work, misstate the phase, hide a heat leak or suppress a needed transport term. Estimate the direction of the bias before estimating its size. A numerical calculation that conserves energy can still violate the second law; similarly, a temperature prediction can be inconsistent with phase equilibrium.

## 5. Verification and measurement protocol

# Unit 8, Lesson 3 — Reacting-system first-law balances

**Learning goals.** Explain the physical meaning of the stated relationship; use the example to reconstruct a verifiable answer; identify at least two model limitations; and propose an independent check.

## 1. Physical question and conceptual model

A reaction changes species amounts and chemical energy. Conservation of atomic elements constrains composition; the first law constrains energy. Enthalpy of formation and a reference temperature let sensible and chemical contributions be summed consistently. Adiabatic flame temperature is an idealized upper benchmark influenced by excess air, dissociation and temperature-dependent heat capacities.


**Professional use.** Establish fuel composition and dry/wet product basis before fitting a combustion model. Avoid jumping from a property value to a performance guarantee: the former describes an assumed state, and the latter depends on losses, materials, reliability and operating limits.

## 2. Build the mathematical relationship

**Governing statement:** `Q−W=H_out−H_in for steady reacting flow (excluding KE/PE)`.


**Model qualification.** The equation is meaningful only when its state and process assumptions are satisfied. Some equations are conservation balances that remain exact for their declared boundary; others are constitutive approximations, such as an ideal-gas relation, a constant heat capacity or an isentropic reference process. Determine which category this statement belongs to. Explain whether extra phenomena such as a moving boundary, leakage, heat loss, multiphase conditions, kinetic energy, electrical work or chemical reaction would add terms or require a different property source. If the process is transient, ask whether an accumulation term is missing.

## 3. Worked teaching example

If a burner releases 500 kW chemical energy and delivers 350 kW useful heat, the accounted remaining 150 kW must appear in exhaust, losses or other output streams.


**Interpretive check.** Does the result increase or decrease when the principal driving condition becomes stronger? Does the prediction approach a sensible limit when the temperature difference, flow rate, state change or relevant force approaches zero? Such limiting tests are not substitutes for a measurement, but they are effective at rejecting a broken model before the expensive stage of building apparatus or selecting equipment.

## 4. Failure analysis and engineering judgement

**A tempting but incorrect shortcut:** Mixing higher and lower heating values without accounting for condensation of product water.

Investigate what this shortcut assumes about the device or material. Predict whether it would overstate useful work, misstate the phase, hide a heat leak or suppress a needed transport term. Estimate the direction of the bias before estimating its size. A numerical calculation that conserves energy can still violate the second law; similarly, a temperature prediction can be inconsistent with phase equilibrium. Test both conservation and state feasibility. Where the model is an ideal upper or lower bound, identify which side of the bound a real machine should occupy under comparable conditions.

It would not claim that an attractive textbook efficiency, coefficient of performance or output power proves achievable production performance.

## 5. Verification and measurement protocol

Design a simple check of **reacting-system first-law balances**. Specify a control volume or control mass, boundary conditions, primary observations and sampling interval. Report whether the observation is direct (temperature, mass, voltage, volumetric flow), indirectly inferred (enthalpy, dryness fraction, exergy), or fitted from an empirical relation. Distinguish repeatability from model validity: a repeatable sensor can be wrongly calibrated, and a perfectly reproducible computer program can implement the wrong equation.

# Unit 8, Lesson 4 — Thermal system selection and integration

**Learning goals.** Explain the physical meaning of the stated relationship; use the example to reconstruct a verifiable answer; identify at least two model limitations; and propose an independent check.

## 1. Physical question and conceptual model

Technology choice is a constrained comparison of useful outputs, temperature grade, duty cycle, fuel and electricity availability, reliability and capital/operating costs. Heat recovery may save energy while increasing pressure drop. Insulation can reduce steady losses but change transient behavior or introduce moisture problems.


**Professional use.** Prepare a sensitivity analysis for energy price, fouling, downtime, labor and expected lifetime. Avoid jumping from a property value to a performance guarantee: the former describes an assumed state, and the latter depends on losses, materials, reliability and operating limits.

## 2. Build the mathematical relationship

**Governing statement:** `Simple payback=capital cost/annual net savings (same currency basis)`.


**Model qualification.** The equation is meaningful only when its state and process assumptions are satisfied. Some equations are conservation balances that remain exact for their declared boundary; others are constitutive approximations, such as an ideal-gas relation, a constant heat capacity or an isentropic reference process. Determine which category this statement belongs to. Explain whether extra phenomena such as a moving boundary, leakage, heat loss, multiphase conditions, kinetic energy, electrical work or chemical reaction would add terms or require a different property source. If the process is transient, ask whether an accumulation term is missing.

## 3. Worked teaching example

An exchanger costing $20,000 with verified net annual savings of $5,000 has simple payback of four years, ignoring discounting and lifetime effects.


**Interpretive check.** Does the result increase or decrease when the principal driving condition becomes stronger? Does the prediction approach a sensible limit when the temperature difference, flow rate, state change or relevant force approaches zero? Such limiting tests are not substitutes for a measurement, but they are effective at rejecting a broken model before the expensive stage of building apparatus or selecting equipment.

## 4. Failure analysis and engineering judgement

**A tempting but incorrect shortcut:** Calling simple payback a full economic appraisal or treating predicted heat recovery as guaranteed savings.

Investigate what this shortcut assumes about the device or material. Predict whether it would overstate useful work, misstate the phase, hide a heat leak or suppress a needed transport term. Estimate the direction of the bias before estimating its size. A numerical calculation that conserves energy can still violate the second law; similarly, a temperature prediction can be inconsistent with phase equilibrium.

# Unit 8, Lesson 5 — Experimental design, verification and ethics

**Learning goals.** Explain the physical meaning of the stated relationship; use the example to reconstruct a verifiable answer; identify at least two model limitations; and propose an independent check.

## 1. Physical question and conceptual model

A credible thermodynamic report distinguishes measured raw signals from processed properties and simulated predictions. Estimate uncertainty, calibrate sensors and record test boundary conditions. Validation against real performance over multiple load points matters more than matching one handpicked point. Safety reviews, codes and environmental rules can override a theoretically efficient concept.


**Professional use.** Write a reproducibility file that records sources, assumptions, versions, checks, and reasons for rejecting unsafe extrapolation. Avoid jumping from a property value to a performance guarantee: the former describes an assumed state, and the latter depends on losses, materials, reliability and operating limits.

## 2. Build the mathematical relationship

**Governing statement:** `Percent discrepancy=100|predicted−measured|/|measured|`.


**Model qualification.** The equation is meaningful only when its state and process assumptions are satisfied. Some equations are conservation balances that remain exact for their declared boundary; others are constitutive approximations, such as an ideal-gas relation, a constant heat capacity or an isentropic reference process. Determine which category this statement belongs to. Explain whether extra phenomena such as a moving boundary, leakage, heat loss, multiphase conditions, kinetic energy, electrical work or chemical reaction would add terms or require a different property source. If the process is transient, ask whether an accumulation term is missing.

## 3. Worked teaching example

A predicted power of 102 kW compared with measured 100 kW shows 2% discrepancy; this alone does not establish agreement unless measurement uncertainty is also known.


**Interpretive check.** Does the result increase or decrease when the principal driving condition becomes stronger? Does the prediction approach a sensible limit when the temperature difference, flow rate, state change or relevant force approaches zero? Such limiting tests are not substitutes for a measurement, but they are effective at rejecting a broken model before the expensive stage of building apparatus or selecting equipment.

## 4. Failure analysis and engineering judgement

**A tempting but incorrect shortcut:** Representing synthetic datasets as measurements or presenting unreviewed educational sliders as certified engineering design software.

Investigate what this shortcut assumes about the device or material. Predict whether it would overstate useful work, misstate the phase, hide a heat leak or suppress a needed transport term.
