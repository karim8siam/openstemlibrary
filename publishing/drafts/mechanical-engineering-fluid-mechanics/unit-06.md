# Unit 6: External Flow, Boundary Layers and Lift/Drag

# Boundary-layer growth and shear

## Unit 6, Lesson 1 — Boundary-layer growth and shear

### Physical question and learning outcome

No-slip boundaries create large velocity gradients in thin near-wall regions. The boundary-layer concept approximates high-Re flow where viscous forces are important near the wall, while outer flow may be represented with an inviscid approximation. Skin-friction drag arises from integrated wall shear. Pressure gradients can accelerate or decelerate the layer and help cause separation.

The reader should be able to describe **boundary-layer growth and shear** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **external flow, boundary layers and lift/drag**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `τ_w=μ(∂u/∂y)_wall`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration. Classify the working statement as an exact balance, a constitutive law, a mathematical definition or an idealized empirical approximation. If a term is neglected, justify that omission with order-of-magnitude reasoning where possible.

Study sensitivity by changing one input over a justified range, but reconsider the regime: velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and density may change together. A one-parameter classroom model does not establish equipment performance.

### Worked illustrative example

For a near-wall velocity change of 1.5 m/s across 0.5 mm and μ=0.001 Pa·s, linear-gradient estimate τ≈3 Pa.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely? A single pressure reading may have several explanations, including geometry error, property variation, transient motion or sensor bias. State which second observation would discriminate between them. Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Interpreting a coarse finite-difference gradient far from the wall as an accurate measured wall shear.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses. A small algebra error and an invalid physical approximation are different problems. In the first case, recompute carefully; in the second, select a more appropriate model or require additional experimental evidence. Examine the units first, then sign conventions, then limiting behavior, then parameter sensitivity, and finally comparison with observations. Reporting an apparent match at one operating point is not validation.

**Applied setting:** Return to the laboratory or field investigation described in the introduction to this unit, and apply this lesson’s relationship to one measurable component of that setting.

For **boundary-layer growth and shear**, decide which geometric dimensions, flow variables and fluid properties matter most. Specify one primary measurement and one independent check, identify a plausible uncertainty source, and explain how a second operating point would help expose an inaccurate assumption. If the instrument samples only one location while the equation needs an integral or an average, explain the required sampling method. In a safety-relevant application, consult the applicable standards and use competent technical review. The simple classroom result must never be treated as a certified equipment rating or field guarantee.

### Three guided exercises

1. **Quantitative adaptation:** Recalculate the worked example after changing one stated driving parameter by 20%, provided the same physical regime remains plausible. Show intermediate SI units. Explain whether a proportional shortcut is justified or whether the complete relation must be re-evaluated.
2. **Model critique:** A colleague claims: “Interpreting a coarse finite-difference gradient far from the wall as an accurate measured wall shear.” Locate the incorrect assumption or definition, describe the likely direction of error if it is predictable, and propose a minimal correction with an observable input.
3. **Experimental design:** Why does an adverse pressure gradient make separation more likely? Specify a plot with physically meaningful axes and units, two controlled operating conditions, an independent measurement, and a falsification criterion. State how you would detect instrument offset, drift or non-repeatability.

**Answer guidance.** Full credit requires mathematical consistency, stated scope, a plausible second measurement and a justified discussion of error. A numerical answer without an identified physical boundary cannot establish the correctness of a fluid-mechanics model. Connect this skill to **Networks and system curves** and then to **Drag coefficients and similarity**. Keep a short data ledger containing symbol, source, unit, uncertainty and whether the value was measured, assumed or computed.

# Drag coefficients and similarity

## Unit 6, Lesson 2 — Drag coefficients and similarity

### Physical question and learning outcome

Total drag includes pressure (form) and shear contributions. Drag coefficient Cd is defined with free-stream dynamic pressure and a specified reference area. Cd depends on shape, angle, surface finish, Reynolds number and possibly Mach number. A numerical Cd without defining area is ambiguous.

The reader should be able to describe **drag coefficients and similarity** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **external flow, boundary layers and lift/drag**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `F_D=½ρV²C_D A_ref`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration.

### Worked illustrative example

At ρ=1.2 kg/m³, V=15 m/s, Cd=0.8 and A=0.5 m²: F_D=54 N.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely?

Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Using frontal area for one Cd and wetted area for another without converting conventions.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses.

# Lift, circulation and airfoil forces

## Unit 6, Lesson 3 — Lift, circulation and airfoil forces

### Physical question and learning outcome

Lift is a component of the net surface force perpendicular to the reference flow direction. It is often reported through Cl and dynamic pressure. Real lift production involves a pressure distribution and flow turning; thin-airfoil and inviscid circulation arguments reveal useful trends but fail near stall or large separation.

The reader should be able to describe **lift, circulation and airfoil forces** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

At ρ=1.2 kg/m³, V=20 m/s, Cl=0.5 and planform area 1 m², lift is 120 N.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Explaining lift by claiming upper and lower air parcels must reunite simultaneously.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses.

# Separation, vortex shedding and bluff bodies

## Unit 6, Lesson 4 — Separation, vortex shedding and bluff bodies

### Physical question and learning outcome

An adverse pressure gradient can cause near-wall flow reversal and separation. Separated shear layers may form a wake, causing unsteady forces, sound and vibrations. Strouhal number links vortex shedding frequency to characteristic speed and length for a defined geometry and regime. Designers must check structural resonance rather than assuming a mean-force calculation captures unsteadiness.

The reader should be able to describe **separation, vortex shedding and bluff bodies** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

This topic sits within the larger unit on **external flow, boundary layers and lift/drag**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `St=fD/V (characteristic shedding frequency)`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension.

For St=0.20, speed 10 m/s and diameter 0.10 m, idealized shedding frequency f=20 Hz.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely?

Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Using one Strouhal coefficient across all shapes, interference conditions and Reynolds numbers.

# Flow around immersed objects and experimental coefficients

## Unit 6, Lesson 5 — Flow around immersed objects and experimental coefficients

### Physical question and learning outcome

Wind-tunnel force balances and pressure taps measure different contributors to aerodynamic load. Blockage, support interference, tunnel wall effects, tare loads and Reynolds scaling can bias tests. Reporting uncertainty alongside coefficients allows comparison with CFD predictions. Repeated sweeps across speeds and angles identify whether a claimed trend is robust.

The reader should be able to describe **flow around immersed objects and experimental coefficients** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **external flow, boundary layers and lift/drag**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `C_p=(p−p∞)/(½ρV∞²)`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension.

### Worked illustrative example

With pressure difference −180 Pa and dynamic pressure 300 Pa, Cp=−0.60.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Treating Cp as an absolute pressure or overlooking the reference location and gauge zero.
