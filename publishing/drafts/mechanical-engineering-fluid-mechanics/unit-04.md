# Unit 4: Momentum, Mechanical Energy and Bernoulli Analysis

# Control-volume linear momentum

## Unit 4, Lesson 1 — Control-volume linear momentum

### Physical question and learning outcome

The momentum equation counts pressure, body force, support reaction and momentum flux. For steady one-dimensional flow in the x direction, the net external x-force equals the difference of outgoing and incoming momentum fluxes. Choose the CV so that unknown surface forces can be meaningfully isolated.

The reader should be able to describe **control-volume linear momentum** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **momentum, mechanical energy and bernoulli analysis**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `ΣF_x=Σ_out ṁV_x−Σ_in ṁV_x (steady)`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration. Classify the working statement as an exact balance, a constitutive law, a mathematical definition or an idealized empirical approximation. If a term is neglected, justify that omission with order-of-magnitude reasoning where possible.

Study sensitivity by changing one input over a justified range, but reconsider the regime: velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and density may change together. A one-parameter classroom model does not establish equipment performance.

### Worked illustrative example

Water flowing at 0.01 m³/s through a nozzle accelerates from 2 to 8 m/s: momentum-flux increase is 1000×0.01×6=60 N.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely? A single pressure reading may have several explanations, including geometry error, property variation, transient motion or sensor bias. State which second observation would discriminate between them. Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Forgetting pressure forces at inlet and outlet while finding support reaction.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses. A small algebra error and an invalid physical approximation are different problems. In the first case, recompute carefully; in the second, select a more appropriate model or require additional experimental evidence. Examine the units first, then sign conventions, then limiting behavior, then parameter sensitivity, and finally comparison with observations. Reporting an apparent match at one operating point is not validation.

**Applied setting:** Return to the laboratory or field investigation described in the introduction to this unit, and apply this lesson’s relationship to one measurable component of that setting.

For **control-volume linear momentum**, decide which geometric dimensions, flow variables and fluid properties matter most. Specify one primary measurement and one independent check, identify a plausible uncertainty source, and explain how a second operating point would help expose an inaccurate assumption. If the instrument samples only one location while the equation needs an integral or an average, explain the required sampling method. In a safety-relevant application, consult the applicable standards and use competent technical review. The simple classroom result must never be treated as a certified equipment rating or field guarantee.

### Three guided exercises

1. **Quantitative adaptation:** Recalculate the worked example after changing one stated driving parameter by 20%, provided the same physical regime remains plausible. Show intermediate SI units. Explain whether a proportional shortcut is justified or whether the complete relation must be re-evaluated.
2. **Model critique:** A colleague claims: “Forgetting pressure forces at inlet and outlet while finding support reaction.” Locate the incorrect assumption or definition, describe the likely direction of error if it is predictable, and propose a minimal correction with an observable input.
3. **Experimental design:** What external reactions change if the nozzle is turned vertically? Specify a plot with physically meaningful axes and units, two controlled operating conditions, an independent measurement, and a falsification criterion. State how you would detect instrument offset, drift or non-repeatability.

**Answer guidance.** Full credit requires mathematical consistency, stated scope, a plausible second measurement and a justified discussion of error. A numerical answer without an identified physical boundary cannot establish the correctness of a fluid-mechanics model. Connect this skill to **Compressible continuity and flow measurement** and then to **Pressure and kinetic energy along streamlines**. Keep a short data ledger containing symbol, source, unit, uncertainty and whether the value was measured, assumed or computed.

# Pressure and kinetic energy along streamlines

## Unit 4, Lesson 2 — Pressure and kinetic energy along streamlines

### Physical question and learning outcome

Mechanical energy per volume is p+½ρV²+ρgz. Under the stated Bernoulli restrictions it is conserved along a streamline. Higher local velocity does not universally imply lower pressure: there may be energy addition, elevation change, flow loss or different streamlines.

The reader should be able to describe **pressure and kinetic energy along streamlines** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **momentum, mechanical energy and bernoulli analysis**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `p₁+½ρV₁²+ρgz₁=p₂+½ρV₂²+ρgz₂`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration.

### Worked illustrative example

For horizontal ideal water flow with V₁=2 m/s and V₂=6 m/s, p₂−p₁=−16 kPa.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely? A single pressure reading may have several explanations, including geometry error, property variation, transient motion or sensor bias. State which second observation would discriminate between them. Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Applying Bernoulli across a pump or a strongly dissipative valve as if the machine were invisible.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses. A small algebra error and an invalid physical approximation are different problems.

# Nozzles, diffusers and tank discharge

## Unit 4, Lesson 3 — Nozzles, diffusers and tank discharge

### Physical question and learning outcome

A nozzle commonly increases kinetic energy while a diffuser slows mean flow to recover static pressure. An ideal open-tank outlet gives Torricelli speed V≈√(2gh) under negligible inlet velocity and losses. Real discharges require a velocity/discharge coefficient and a hydraulic loss analysis.

The reader should be able to describe **nozzles, diffusers and tank discharge** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

### Worked illustrative example

An orifice 1.8 m below an open reservoir surface has ideal speed √(2×9.81×1.8)≈5.94 m/s.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Using ideal outflow to specify actual discharge without area contraction and loss coefficients.

# Head loss and hydraulic-grade lines

## Unit 4, Lesson 4 — Head loss and hydraulic-grade lines

### Physical question and learning outcome

For an incompressible liquid, pressure head p/(ρg), velocity head V²/(2g), and elevation z together describe mechanical head. Pumps add head, turbines extract head and internal losses consume it. Hydraulic grade equals z+p/(ρg); energy grade includes velocity head. A properly drawn line is a powerful sanity test of pressure predictions.

The reader should be able to describe **head loss and hydraulic-grade lines** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

This topic sits within the larger unit on **momentum, mechanical energy and bernoulli analysis**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `p₁/(ρg)+V₁²/(2g)+z₁+h_p=h_L+h_t+p₂/(ρg)+V₂²/(2g)+z₂`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed.

### Worked illustrative example

A pump adds 18 m of head and an intervening line loses 5 m: net available mechanical-head rise across the combined segment is 13 m.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely?

Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Treating pressure head as the only component of total head or treating losses as negative on both sides of the equation.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses.

# Angular momentum and swirling flows

## Unit 4, Lesson 5 — Angular momentum and swirling flows

### Physical question and learning outcome

Angular momentum balances torque against transport of r×V. Turbomachine rotor torque can be estimated from changes in tangential velocity at inlet and outlet. A free vortex approximates uθ∝1/r outside a viscous core, while solid-body rotation gives uθ∝r. Swirl must not be interpreted without specifying its flow field.

The reader should be able to describe **angular momentum and swirling flows** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **momentum, mechanical energy and bernoulli analysis**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `T_z= ṁ (r₂Vθ₂−r₁Vθ₁) (steady, one inlet/outlet)`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration. Classify the working statement as an exact balance, a constitutive law, a mathematical definition or an idealized empirical approximation. If a term is neglected, justify that omission with order-of-magnitude reasoning where possible.

Study sensitivity by changing one input over a justified range, but reconsider the regime: velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and density may change together. A one-parameter classroom model does not establish equipment performance.

### Worked illustrative example

At ṁ=3 kg/s with change in rVθ of 0.4 m²/s, angular-momentum torque is 1.2 N·m.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely?

Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Using axial velocity instead of tangential velocity in an Euler turbomachine balance.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses. A small algebra error and an invalid physical approximation are different problems. In the first case, recompute carefully; in the second, select a more appropriate model or require additional experimental evidence.
