## Unit 1, Lesson 1 — What makes a material a fluid?

### Physical question and learning outcome

A fluid continually deforms under a sustained shear stress. In a solid an equilibrium shear strain may persist; in a fluid a shear rate persists while a nonzero shear stress is maintained. The distinction is temporal: a viscoelastic material may resemble a solid on short time scales and a fluid on long time scales.

The reader should be able to describe **what makes a material a fluid?** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **fluid properties, dimensional analysis and continuum mechanics**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `τ = μ (du/dy) for a Newtonian fluid`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration. Classify the working statement as an exact balance, a constitutive law, a mathematical definition or an idealized empirical approximation. If a term is neglected, justify that omission with order-of-magnitude reasoning where possible.

Study sensitivity by changing one input over a justified range, but reconsider the regime: velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and density may change together. A one-parameter classroom model does not establish equipment performance.

### Worked illustrative example

A fluid between parallel plates separated by 2 mm has a 0.20 m/s velocity difference and μ=0.50 Pa·s: τ=0.50(0.20/0.002)=50 Pa.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely? A single pressure reading may have several explanations, including geometry error, property variation, transient motion or sensor bias. State which second observation would discriminate between them. Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Using this Newtonian equation for every paste, slurry, blood sample or polymer melt without determining the rheology.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses. A small algebra error and an invalid physical approximation are different problems. In the first case, recompute carefully; in the second, select a more appropriate model or require additional experimental evidence. Examine the units first, then sign conventions, then limiting behavior, then parameter sensitivity, and finally comparison with observations. Reporting an apparent match at one operating point is not validation.

**Applied setting:** Return to the laboratory or field investigation described in the introduction to this unit, and apply this lesson’s relationship to one measurable component of that setting.

For **what makes a material a fluid?**, decide which geometric dimensions, flow variables and fluid properties matter most. Specify one primary measurement and one independent check, identify a plausible uncertainty source, and explain how a second operating point would help expose an inaccurate assumption. If the instrument samples only one location while the equation needs an integral or an average, explain the required sampling method. In a safety-relevant application, consult the applicable standards and use competent technical review. The simple classroom result must never be treated as a certified equipment rating or field guarantee.

### Three guided exercises

1. **Quantitative adaptation:** Recalculate the worked example after changing one stated driving parameter by 20%, provided the same physical regime remains plausible. Show intermediate SI units. Explain whether a proportional shortcut is justified or whether the complete relation must be re-evaluated.
2. **Model critique:** A colleague claims: “Using this Newtonian equation for every paste, slurry, blood sample or polymer melt without determining the rheology.” Locate the incorrect assumption or definition, describe the likely direction of error if it is predictable, and propose a minimal correction with an observable input.
3. **Experimental design:** How would the inferred shear stress change if the gap doubled at the same relative velocity? Specify a plot with physically meaningful axes and units, two controlled operating conditions, an independent measurement, and a falsification criterion. State how you would detect instrument offset, drift or non-repeatability.

**Answer guidance.** Full credit requires mathematical consistency, stated scope, a plausible second measurement and a justified discussion of error. A numerical answer without an identified physical boundary cannot establish the correctness of a fluid-mechanics model. Connect this skill to **introductory concepts and measurement conventions** and then to **Density, specific gravity and compressibility**. Keep a short data ledger containing symbol, source, unit, uncertainty and whether the value was measured, assumed or computed.

# Density, specific gravity and compressibility

## Unit 1, Lesson 2 — Density, specific gravity and compressibility

### Physical question and learning outcome

Density is a mass-to-volume ratio. Specific gravity compares density with a stated reference density, conventionally water for liquids. The bulk modulus measures the pressure sensitivity of volume and may be treated as large for modest liquid pressure changes. Air density at ordinary conditions is sensitive to absolute pressure and temperature.

The reader should be able to describe **density, specific gravity and compressibility** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig. Describe the boundary before inserting numbers: an unknown pressure, mass flux or force will have a different meaning when the boundary changes. This topic sits within the larger unit on **fluid properties, dimensional analysis and continuum mechanics**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `ρ=m/V; K=−V(dp/dV)`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed. Determine whether pressure is gauge, absolute, static or stagnation pressure. Note whether the geometric length is pipe bore, vertical depth, capillary radius or another reference dimension. A dimensionless correlation is not interchangeable with a conservation principle: its coefficient can be specific to flow regime, geometry and experimental calibration.

### Worked illustrative example

A 4.00 kg liquid sample occupies 0.00400 m³: ρ=1000 kg/m³. At density 850 kg/m³ and a 1000 kg/m³ reference, SG=0.85.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end. Assess whether the magnitude is physically sensible. Where useful, reverse the calculation: if the predicted response were measured, could it reveal the unknown parameter uniquely?

Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Using gauge pressure instead of absolute pressure in a gas equation or treating specific gravity as a quantity with units.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses. A small algebra error and an invalid physical approximation are different problems.

# Viscosity and rate of deformation

## Unit 1, Lesson 3 — Viscosity and rate of deformation

### Physical question and learning outcome

Dynamic viscosity μ connects shear stress to velocity gradient in a Newtonian fluid. Kinematic viscosity ν=μ/ρ has dimensions of area per time and appears in the Reynolds number. Many liquids thin as temperature increases; many gases show the opposite trend. Real pipe flows have velocity gradients even when the average axial speed is uniform.

The reader should be able to describe **viscosity and rate of deformation** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

### Worked illustrative example

Water-like fluid with μ=1.00×10⁻³ Pa·s and ρ=1000 kg/m³ has ν=1.00×10⁻⁶ m²/s.

To reconstruct the calculation, first express inputs in base SI units, write the symbolic relationship, replace symbols with measured or stated quantities, retain units through arithmetic, and round only at the end.

Calculated values in this lesson are synthetic teaching examples, not plant measurements.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Confusing Pa·s with m²/s; inserting centipoise values as if they were SI values.

Analyze why this fails: it may discard an important gradient, confuse a local speed with a cross-sectional mean, mix absolute and gauge pressures, ignore a storage term, use a coefficient outside its regime, or assume an ideal device has no losses.

# Surface tension, capillarity and vapor pressure

## Unit 1, Lesson 4 — Surface tension, capillarity and vapor pressure

### Physical question and learning outcome

Surface tension acts at an interface and can dominate in small channels. A capillary rise or depression balances a wetting-related interfacial force against hydrostatic weight. Vapor pressure is a thermodynamic property: liquid near or below its vapor pressure may form vapor cavities. These phenomena often appear at a scale where ordinary pipe correlations are unreliable.

The reader should be able to describe **surface tension, capillarity and vapor pressure** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

This topic sits within the larger unit on **fluid properties, dimensional analysis and continuum mechanics**.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `h=2σ cosθ/(ρgr) (circular capillary idealization)`.

Identify each symbol before substitution. Ask whether velocity denotes centerline, cross-sectional mean, tangential or free-stream speed.

# Dimensional homogeneity and similarity

## Unit 1, Lesson 5 — Dimensional homogeneity and similarity

### Physical question and learning outcome

Buckingham Π arguments reduce the number of independent dimensions, enabling designs to compare model and full-scale behavior. Froude similarity matters when gravity waves dominate, Reynolds similarity when viscous/inertial competition matters, and Mach similarity when compressibility matters. Not all groups can be matched simultaneously with the same model fluid and scale.

The reader should be able to describe **dimensional homogeneity and similarity** using a diagram, distinguish the primary observed quantity from the inferred response, use the equation below with compatible SI units, and explain one condition under which the result may fail. The relevant boundary can be a portion of water in a reservoir, fluid inside a duct, a freely moving external-flow body, or a test rig.

### Governing statement and assumptions

**Working relationship:** `Re=ρVD/μ; Fr=V/√(gL); Ma=V/c`.

### Research and design interpretation

**Common failure mode:** Assuming a visual resemblance between two flows means their drag or pressure-drop coefficients agree.
