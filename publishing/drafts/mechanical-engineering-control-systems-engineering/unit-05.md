# U05-L01 — Proportional control and closed-loop stiffness

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 5: PID, Compensation and Practical Tuning.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **proportional control and closed-loop stiffness** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

Proportional action u=K_p e turns error into an immediate control change. In a first-order stable plant it can reduce time constant and offset, but it does not automatically remove the steady error of a type-0 unity-feedback system.

**System context.** A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Design controllers around explicit tracking, disturbance and actuator constraints, not universal tuning constants. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

For plant G=K/(τs+1), proportional control gives denominator τs+1+KK_p. The closed-loop time constant is τ/(1+KK_p) and the closed-loop reference DC gain is KK_p/(1+KK_p). The actuator command must be checked against its physical bounds.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For proportional control and closed-loop stiffness, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

With K=2, τ=4 s and K_p=1.5, the ideal closed-loop τ becomes 1 s, while unit-step output tends to 0.75.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

Derivative-free proportional design may be preferable when sensor resolution is coarse and the process already integrates naturally.

This limitation matters particularly for **proportional control and closed-loop stiffness**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

1. **Define the measurement.** For this lesson, identify the smallest set of sensors that can distinguish the predicted mechanism from an alternative explanation. Record calibration, range, resolution, sampling rate and timestamps. Do not use commanded actuator signals as though they were measured actuator output.

2. **Plan excitation.** Choose a reversible stimulus small enough to respect the independent safety limits in the case: A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. A step, ramp, chirp, frequency sweep or deliberate small load perturbation may be appropriate, but there is no universal safe test amplitude. Start with the smallest informative test.

3. **Predict first.** Use the selected model to forecast the direction, scale and timing of at least one observation. Include what would refute the prediction. Predictions recorded before an experiment reduce the temptation to tune the story after seeing the result.

4. **Collect independent evidence.** Compare the predicted and measured quantities at more than one operating condition, including a held-out condition not used to fit parameters. Report transients, steady behavior and the actuator command on separate channels. Record uncertainty and do not hide residual patterns by averaging them away.

5. **Revise and document.** If the data disagree, consider model order, omitted delay, calibration bias, nonlinearity or incorrect sign before raising controller gain. Save the model version, parameter ranges, test date, and outstanding safety questions.

## Guided problems

**Problem A — definitions.** Draw the complete signal path for a system that must demonstrate proportional control and closed-loop stiffness. Mark the reference, measured output, actual output, process disturbance and actuator constraint. State which quantities can be directly measured and which must be estimated.

**Problem B — quantitative reproduction.** Rework the example in this lesson using SI units, then change one numerical input by 10%. Report the result and a dimensionless sensitivity ratio. Explain whether a first-order approximation is appropriate.

**Problem C — alternate assumption.** Repeat the reasoning after adding either finite sample time, sensor bias or actuator saturation. Identify precisely which mathematical step is no longer valid and whether the expected effect is on stability, steady-state error or transient response.

**Problem D — experiment design.** Write a one-page safe bench-test protocol covering instrument checks, recorded variables, stimulus limits, shutdown logic and criteria for rejecting a fitted model. You must distinguish acceptance of a numerical model from approval to operate equipment.

**Problem E — peer challenge.** Argue against a proposed design that optimizes only one metric (such as settling time). Name at least two competing metrics and explain why evidence from the running case might change the preferred design.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Keep each parameter attached to its physical units and measured provenance. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **proportional control and closed-loop stiffness**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U05-L02 — Integral control and PI design

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 5: PID, Compensation and Practical Tuning.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **integral control and pi design** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

Integral action u=K_p e+K_i∫e dt accumulates past errors and can eliminate constant steady-state offsets under stable, nonsaturated conditions. The integral time T_i=K_p/K_i is meaningful only for K_i>0 with consistent units.

**System context.** A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Design controllers around explicit tracking, disturbance and actuator constraints, not universal tuning constants. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

A PI compensator C=K_p+K_i/s introduces a pole at the origin and a zero at −K_i/K_p. Choose the zero relative to plant time constants and verify the resulting closed-loop poles. Integral gain that is too high can create oscillation and large actuator commands.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For integral control and pi design, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

For K_p=2 and K_i=0.5 s⁻¹ in matching normalized units, the PI zero is at −0.25 rad/s and integral time is 4 s.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

A sensor bias causes integral action to correct a biased value rather than the true process output.

This limitation matters particularly for **integral control and pi design**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Separate the equation derived under assumptions from the test that could challenge it. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **integral control and pi design**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U05-L03 — Derivative action and filtered PID

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 5: PID, Compensation and Practical Tuning.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **derivative action and filtered pid** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

Derivative action can add damping by responding to changes but differentiating measurement noise without filtering is hazardous. Practical PID uses filtered derivative, usually on measurement rather than setpoint to avoid derivative kick.

**System context.** A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Design controllers around explicit tracking, disturbance and actuator constraints, not universal tuning constants. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

A common implementation is u=K_p e+I−K_d (N/(s+N)) dy/dt in a suitable continuous representation; more generally use a first-order filtered differentiator K_d Ns/(s+N) acting on measurement. Specify whether gains use parallel, ideal or series PID conventions.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For derivative action and filtered pid, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

If measurement increases at 2°C/s and K_d=0.8 %heater·s/°C, ideal derivative-on-measurement requests a −1.6 percentage-point command adjustment before filtering.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

Time delay, noisy quantization and high sensor bandwidth can produce actuator chatter when derivative filtering is too weak.

This limitation matters particularly for **derivative action and filtered pid**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

1. **Define the measurement.** For this lesson, identify the smallest set of sensors that can distinguish the predicted mechanism from an alternative explanation.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Check the controller command and all constrained internal states, not merely the output. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **derivative action and filtered pid**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U05-L04 — Anti-windup, setpoint shaping and bumpless transfer

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 5: PID, Compensation and Practical Tuning.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **anti-windup, setpoint shaping and bumpless transfer** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

Saturation separates requested controller output v from actual actuator signal u=sat(v). A PI integrator that continues accumulating large error while saturated may overshoot severely on recovery. Anti-windup uses clamping or back-calculation.

**System context.** A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Design controllers around explicit tracking, disturbance and actuator constraints, not universal tuning constants. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

With back-calculation, İ=K_i e+K_aw(u−v) for compatible units. A setpoint ramp or reference prefilter can control startup without weakening disturbance response. For manual-to-auto transfer, initialize the integrator consistently with the current actuator output.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For anti-windup, setpoint shaping and bumpless transfer, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

A heater with 0–100% command saturates at 100% during a large temperature change; stopping integral accumulation when the same error direction deepens saturation shortens recovery.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

Anti-windup is not a substitute for correctly sized actuators or safety shutdowns.

This limitation matters particularly for **anti-windup, setpoint shaping and bumpless transfer**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Use the result as a foundation for a decision with a stated uncertainty interval. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **anti-windup, setpoint shaping and bumpless transfer**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U05-L05 — Lead–lag compensation and tuning protocols

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 5: PID, Compensation and Practical Tuning.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **lead–lag compensation and tuning protocols** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

A lead network C(s)=K(1+sT)/(1+sαT) with 0<α<1 adds phase over a frequency band; a lag network can improve low-frequency gain relative to high-frequency gain but typically slows response.

**System context.** A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Design controllers around explicit tracking, disturbance and actuator constraints, not universal tuning constants. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

Choose target crossover and phase margin with delay and parasitic modes included; place lead zero and pole around crossover and verify actual magnitude changes. Record pre-tuning and post-tuning tests under identical command and disturbance inputs.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For lead–lag compensation and tuning protocols, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

For α=0.25, maximum ideal phase lead is asin((1−α)/(1+α))≈36.9°. It occurs near ω≈1/(T√α).

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

A tidy simulated phase-margin increase is insufficient evidence if saturation or digital sampling dominates the field plant.

This limitation matters particularly for **lead–lag compensation and tuning protocols**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

1. **Define the measurement.** For this lesson, identify the smallest set of sensors that can distinguish the predicted mechanism from an alternative explanation. Record calibration, range, resolution, sampling rate and timestamps. Do not use commanded actuator signals as though they were measured actuator output.

2. **Plan excitation.** Choose a reversible stimulus small enough to respect the independent safety limits in the case: A packaging-line speed loop needs smooth startup, constant-speed load rejection and reliable recovery after a motor current limit. A step, ramp, chirp, frequency sweep or deliberate small load perturbation may be appropriate, but there is no universal safe test amplitude. Start with the smallest informative test.

4. **Collect independent evidence.** Compare the predicted and measured quantities at more than one operating condition, including a held-out condition not used to fit parameters. Report transients, steady behavior and the actuator command on separate channels. Record uncertainty and do not hide residual patterns by averaging them away.

5. **Revise and document.** If the data disagree, consider model order, omitted delay, calibration bias, nonlinearity or incorrect sign before raising controller gain. Save the model version, parameter ranges, test date, and outstanding safety questions.

## Guided problems

**Problem A — definitions.** Draw the complete signal path for a system that must demonstrate lead–lag compensation and tuning protocols. Mark the reference, measured output, actual output, process disturbance and actuator constraint. State which quantities can be directly measured and which must be estimated.

**Problem B — quantitative reproduction.** Rework the example in this lesson using SI units, then change one numerical input by 10%. Report the result and a dimensionless sensitivity ratio. Explain whether a first-order approximation is appropriate.

**Problem C — alternate assumption.** Repeat the reasoning after adding either finite sample time, sensor bias or actuator saturation. Identify precisely which mathematical step is no longer valid and whether the expected effect is on stability, steady-state error or transient response.

**Problem D — experiment design.** Write a one-page safe bench-test protocol covering instrument checks, recorded variables, stimulus limits, shutdown logic and criteria for rejecting a fitted model. You must distinguish acceptance of a numerical model from approval to operate equipment.

**Problem E — peer challenge.** Argue against a proposed design that optimizes only one metric (such as settling time). Name at least two competing metrics and explain why evidence from the running case might change the preferred design.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Identify the cause of the response, not only the observed waveform. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **lead–lag compensation and tuning protocols**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.
