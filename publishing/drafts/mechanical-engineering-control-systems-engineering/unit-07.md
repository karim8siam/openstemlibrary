# U07-L01 — Sampling rates and zero-order hold

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 7: Digital Control and Implementation.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **sampling rates and zero-order hold** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

A digital controller samples sensor signals and holds an actuator command until the next update. Nyquist sampling provides a necessary reconstruction condition for band-limited signals, but robust control often requires sampling much faster than the closed-loop bandwidth.

**System context.** A digitally controlled heater appears stable at 100 Hz sampling but performs poorly when its sensor updates only every 5 seconds. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Treat sample time, quantization, update ordering and computation delay as part of the plant. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

Choose sampling from fastest relevant plant dynamics, sensor filters, computational delay and noise. A zero-order hold adds a frequency-dependent lag. Measurements from asynchronous buses must carry timestamps.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For sampling rates and zero-order hold, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

For a 5 Hz oscillation, a 12 Hz sample rate barely exceeds the Nyquist threshold; 100 Hz yields twenty samples per cycle and better waveform resolution.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

An apparent signal at low frequency may be an alias of a higher frequency component, not a true plant mode.

This limitation matters particularly for **sampling rates and zero-order hold**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

1. **Define the measurement.** For this lesson, identify the smallest set of sensors that can distinguish the predicted mechanism from an alternative explanation. Record calibration, range, resolution, sampling rate and timestamps. Do not use commanded actuator signals as though they were measured actuator output.

2. **Plan excitation.** Choose a reversible stimulus small enough to respect the independent safety limits in the case: A digitally controlled heater appears stable at 100 Hz sampling but performs poorly when its sensor updates only every 5 seconds. A step, ramp, chirp, frequency sweep or deliberate small load perturbation may be appropriate, but there is no universal safe test amplitude. Start with the smallest informative test.

3. **Predict first.** Use the selected model to forecast the direction, scale and timing of at least one observation. Include what would refute the prediction. Predictions recorded before an experiment reduce the temptation to tune the story after seeing the result.

4. **Collect independent evidence.** Compare the predicted and measured quantities at more than one operating condition, including a held-out condition not used to fit parameters. Report transients, steady behavior and the actuator command on separate channels. Record uncertainty and do not hide residual patterns by averaging them away.

5. **Revise and document.** If the data disagree, consider model order, omitted delay, calibration bias, nonlinearity or incorrect sign before raising controller gain. Save the model version, parameter ranges, test date, and outstanding safety questions.

## Guided problems

**Problem A — definitions.** Draw the complete signal path for a system that must demonstrate sampling rates and zero-order hold. Mark the reference, measured output, actual output, process disturbance and actuator constraint. State which quantities can be directly measured and which must be estimated.

**Problem B — quantitative reproduction.** Rework the example in this lesson using SI units, then change one numerical input by 10%. Report the result and a dimensionless sensitivity ratio. Explain whether a first-order approximation is appropriate.

**Problem C — alternate assumption.** Repeat the reasoning after adding either finite sample time, sensor bias or actuator saturation. Identify precisely which mathematical step is no longer valid and whether the expected effect is on stability, steady-state error or transient response.

**Problem D — experiment design.** Write a one-page safe bench-test protocol covering instrument checks, recorded variables, stimulus limits, shutdown logic and criteria for rejecting a fitted model. You must distinguish acceptance of a numerical model from approval to operate equipment.

**Problem E — peer challenge.** Argue against a proposed design that optimizes only one metric (such as settling time). Name at least two competing metrics and explain why evidence from the running case might change the preferred design.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Check the controller command and all constrained internal states, not merely the output. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **sampling rates and zero-order hold**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U07-L02 — Discrete-time models and z-transforms

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 7: Digital Control and Implementation.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **discrete-time models and z-transforms** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

A continuous first-order model ẋ=−x/τ+(K/τ)u, under exact ZOH sampling h, becomes x[k+1]=a x[k]+K(1−a)u[k], a=e^(−h/τ). This makes sampling dependence explicit.

**System context.** A digitally controlled heater appears stable at 100 Hz sampling but performs poorly when its sensor updates only every 5 seconds. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Treat sample time, quantization, update ordering and computation delay as part of the plant. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

Obtain the discrete state update by integrating the continuous equation across one hold interval. Discrete transfer functions use z rather than s; placement of the input sample index and direct feedthrough must be documented.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For discrete-time models and z-transforms, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

For τ=2 s and h=0.1 s, a=e⁻⁰·⁰⁵≈0.951229 and the input coefficient for K=3 is ≈0.146312.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

Replacing a continuous pole by 1−h/τ is only an Euler approximation and can become unstable for excessively large h.

This limitation matters particularly for **discrete-time models and z-transforms**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Use the result as a foundation for a decision with a stated uncertainty interval. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **discrete-time models and z-transforms**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U07-L03 — Discrete stability and pole mapping

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 7: Digital Control and Implementation.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **discrete stability and pole mapping** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

A discrete LTI system is asymptotically stable when all modes have |z|<1. The mapping from continuous pole s to exact sampled pole z=e^(sh) preserves stable locations under positive sampling time, before computational delay and numerical approximation are added.

**System context.** A digitally controlled heater appears stable at 100 Hz sampling but performs poorly when its sensor updates only every 5 seconds. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Treat sample time, quantization, update ordering and computation delay as part of the plant. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

For real discrete pole a, the state decays as a^k when |a|<1; alternating sign occurs with negative a. For complex poles, radius controls decay and argument controls oscillation per sample.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For discrete stability and pole mapping, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

A pole at s=−4 s⁻¹ with h=0.05 s maps to z=e⁻⁰·²≈0.81873, strictly inside the unit circle.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

A simulation with a stable numerical integrator is not evidence the implemented sampled-data closed loop is robust to jitter and sensor dropout.

This limitation matters particularly for **discrete stability and pole mapping**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

4. **Collect independent evidence.** Compare the predicted and measured quantities at more than one operating condition, including a held-out condition not used to fit parameters. Report transients, steady behavior and the actuator command on separate channels. Record uncertainty and do not hide residual patterns by averaging them away.

5. **Revise and document.** If the data disagree, consider model order, omitted delay, calibration bias, nonlinearity or incorrect sign before raising controller gain. Save the model version, parameter ranges, test date, and outstanding safety questions.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Identify the cause of the response, not only the observed waveform. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **discrete stability and pole mapping**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U07-L04 — Digital PI/PID, saturation and computation delay

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 7: Digital Control and Implementation.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **digital pi/pid, saturation and computation delay** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

A digital PI can use I[k+1]=I[k]+K_i h e[k], u[k]=sat(K_p e[k]+I[k]); the exact update order matters. Difference approximations to derivative need filtering to avoid violent reaction to quantization.

**System context.** A digitally controlled heater appears stable at 100 Hz sampling but performs poorly when its sensor updates only every 5 seconds. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Treat sample time, quantization, update ordering and computation delay as part of the plant. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

Use a saturating, timestamp-aware implementation; separate desired unsaturated v[k] and actual constrained actuator u[k]. Include communication delay, computation overhead, safety watchdog and missed-sample behavior. A controller that works with one update order may differ with another.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For digital pi/pid, saturation and computation delay, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

With K_i=0.4 s⁻¹, h=0.2 s and e[k]=5 units, one rectangular integrator update adds 0.4 actuator units.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

Numerical overflow, unit casting, integer saturation and watchdog resets create failure modes absent from continuous-time equations.

This limitation matters particularly for **digital pi/pid, saturation and computation delay**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

1. **Define the measurement.** For this lesson, identify the smallest set of sensors that can distinguish the predicted mechanism from an alternative explanation. Record calibration, range, resolution, sampling rate and timestamps. Do not use commanded actuator signals as though they were measured actuator output.

**Problem A — definitions.** Draw the complete signal path for a system that must demonstrate digital pi/pid, saturation and computation delay.

**Problem E — peer challenge.** Argue against a proposed design that optimizes only one metric (such as settling time). Name at least two competing metrics and explain why evidence from the running case might change the preferred design.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Keep each parameter attached to its physical units and measured provenance. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **digital pi/pid, saturation and computation delay**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.

# U07-L05 — Quantization, filtering, latency and deployment

**Mechanical Engineering · Control Systems Engineering · Unit 7: Digital Control and Implementation.**  This is an unreviewed instructional chapter; none of its calculations alone justifies commissioning machinery.

## What you should be able to do

Explain **quantization, filtering, latency and deployment** without confusing measured variables, hidden dynamics and desired behavior; write the main equation and derive its assumptions; reproduce the numerical illustration; diagnose at least two ways the model may mislead; and propose a practical, limited-risk verification experiment.

## Physical interpretation

Sensors quantize a physical quantity to finite resolution; commands may have dead bands, PWM granularity or rate limits. Digital filtering attenuates noise but introduces delay, which changes phase margin.

**System context.** A digitally controlled heater appears stable at 100 Hz sampling but performs poorly when its sensor updates only every 5 seconds. The objective in this lesson is not an abstract good-looking response: Treat sample time, quantization, update ordering and computation delay as part of the plant. Establish whether the lesson concerns the plant itself, the mathematical input/output map, an estimator, a controller, or a test method. Those roles cannot be interchanged. A controller parameter may improve the command-response plot and simultaneously create unacceptable actuator current, mechanical strain or sensor-noise transmission.

## Derivation and use

When commissioning, log target time, acquisition time, calculation completion and drive-command acknowledgement separately. Inject harmless test signals, validate watchdog behavior and require a defined safe state when sensor input is missing.

**Dimensional and sign audit.** Before substituting values, define an input and output in physical units, choose a positive direction, identify zero or equilibrium conditions, and make sure both sides of any differential or algebraic equation have the same dimensions. For quantization, filtering, latency and deployment, changing coordinates or the chosen sensor location can reverse the sign or modify the apparent dynamics. A formula for ideal negative feedback must not be used when actual wiring implements positive feedback. Explicitly distinguish a continuous-time differential equation from a discrete update at sample index k.

## Worked numerical illustration

A 12-bit ADC over 0–10 V has step size 10/4096≈2.44 mV. A plant with 0.05°C/mV sensor gain therefore has ≈0.122°C per code in this synthetic illustration.

**Reproduction protocol.** Write the givens and units in a table, compute any derived time scales or gains, substitute into the displayed model and calculate the result with more precision than required for the final reported value. Compare against a limiting case: zero disturbance, zero controller gain, vanishing sample time, or a stationary equilibrium as appropriate. If a calculation predicts infinite control force, negative dissipation, or motion through a hard stop, that is an indication to revisit assumptions, not a valid operating instruction.

## What the calculation does not establish

Increasing digital filter strength without recalculating delay can turn a stable controller into an oscillatory one.

This limitation matters particularly for **quantization, filtering, latency and deployment**. The simplified example contains no manufacturing tolerances, no equipment-specific safety certification, and no direct evidence about the chosen hardware. Extra physics—sensor lag, actuator limits, cross-coupling, higher modes, friction, temperature drift or sampling delay—must be assessed according to the application. A model can be mathematically stable while the experiment violates the permitted range of current, speed, force or temperature.

## Practical reasoning and validation

1. **Define the measurement.** For this lesson, identify the smallest set of sensors that can distinguish the predicted mechanism from an alternative explanation. Record calibration, range, resolution, sampling rate and timestamps. Do not use commanded actuator signals as though they were measured actuator output.

3. **Predict first.** Use the selected model to forecast the direction, scale and timing of at least one observation. Include what would refute the prediction. Predictions recorded before an experiment reduce the temptation to tune the story after seeing the result.

4. **Collect independent evidence.** Compare the predicted and measured quantities at more than one operating condition, including a held-out condition not used to fit parameters. Report transients, steady behavior and the actuator command on separate channels. Record uncertainty and do not hide residual patterns by averaging them away.

5. **Revise and document.** If the data disagree, consider model order, omitted delay, calibration bias, nonlinearity or incorrect sign before raising controller gain. Save the model version, parameter ranges, test date, and outstanding safety questions.

## Guided problems

**Problem A — definitions.** Draw the complete signal path for a system that must demonstrate quantization, filtering, latency and deployment. Mark the reference, measured output, actual output, process disturbance and actuator constraint. State which quantities can be directly measured and which must be estimated.

**Problem D — experiment design.** Write a one-page safe bench-test protocol covering instrument checks, recorded variables, stimulus limits, shutdown logic and criteria for rejecting a fitted model. You must distinguish acceptance of a numerical model from approval to operate equipment.

**Problem E — peer challenge.** Argue against a proposed design that optimizes only one metric (such as settling time). Name at least two competing metrics and explain why evidence from the running case might change the preferred design.

## Worked answer path (not a substitute for a full design)

For A, write a block diagram with sensor noise entering the measurement channel and the disturbance entering the correct physical location; this prevents confusion between feedback error and actual tracking error. For B, compute the baseline result, recompute at 1.10 times the chosen parameter, and use sensitivity approximately (Δoutput/output)/(Δparameter/parameter), describing sign and any nonlinear dependence. For C, identify the changed assumption first; do not silently reuse the nominal transfer function. For D, report a test trace and a safety boundary independently. For E, make the tradeoff explicit rather than calling the fastest response automatically best.

## Reflection and next step

Separate the equation derived under assumptions from the test that could challenge it. Identify a single observation that would make you question the conclusion about **quantization, filtering, latency and deployment**. At the end of the lesson record one corrected assumption, one remaining unknown and one measurable next action. The next section extends this reasoning to another part of the control loop; keep the previous model as a baseline for comparison.
