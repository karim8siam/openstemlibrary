# U03-L01 — Four-bar vector closure

**Unit 3: Four-Bar and Slider-Crank Mechanisms · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** How do four known link lengths constrain two unknown angles?

**Scenario:** A rocker driven by a rotating crank has two possible assembly configurations. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `r1+r2+r3+r4=0 for a directed closed loop`.

The closure equation is geometric; force equilibrium and required driver torque must be solved separately. Draw the fixed pivots and input crank before solving unknown links. The law of cosines can give the same assembly angle as a vector-closure solution, but quadrant choice and branch tracking remain essential. A continuous physical mechanism normally follows one solution branch until constrained by contact or an exceptional configuration. For slider-crank geometry, exact rod obliquity distinguishes motion from the sinusoidal long-rod approximation. In a four-bar, Grashof geometry indicates potential rotations only with a specified inversion. A transmission angle near an undesirable extreme can increase joint force for the same useful output even when the mathematical displacement remains smooth.

Define each independent quantity and units before substitution. If a formula contains an angle derivative, convert degrees to radians and apply the chain rule to move from angle to time. For a constrained mechanism, first solve position closure and then differentiate to obtain velocity and acceleration. For a loaded mechanism, separate the purely kinematic result from required contact reactions and input torque. Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Closed-loop horizontal residual 0.2 mm, vertical residual 0.3 mm.

**Calculation — Closure residual magnitude:** **0.000360555 m**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Accepting a root that jumps from the open branch to the crossed branch without explanation.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Perturb one four-bar length by one percent while holding three others fixed. Investigate whether the same output branch still exists. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement. Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Compute closure residuals for successive angles and animate a consistent assembly branch. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely. Keep synthetic values separated from measured observations, and do not count the same input data as independent validation.

The report should contain a labeled schematic, equations, raw input table, one calculated output and its units, a sensitivity result and a discrepancy explanation. If an observed path differs from the model, consider perspective error, misidentified joints, slippage, structural flexibility, bearing clearance and unintended motion. Decide which extra measurement would distinguish the most plausible causes. A useful verification plan explains not only what evidence would support a model but what evidence would require it to be revised.

## Exercises and assessment

1. **Numerical variation:** Recalculate the worked example after changing one driving parameter by 15%. State the new answer, its units and the percentage change. Identify any hidden domain restriction, such as a minimum rod length or positive stiffness.
2. **Mechanism reasoning:** How do four known link lengths constrain two unknown angles? Contrast the original situation with a changed link, joint, contact condition or speed regime. Draw the new physical picture and explain which equation remains valid, requires modification or fails.
3. **Model critique:** Design an independent test for the proposed investigation, including measured variables, instrument calibration, repeatability, one confounding factor and a rejection criterion.

## Design review conclusion

**Four-bar vector closure** provides one part of a complete machine analysis. Deliver a brief calculation memo with an explicit operating range and at least one technical limitation. Evaluate the result against mechanism geometry and energy conservation, and list any unresolved requirements for guards, rated components, fatigue testing, maintenance or industrial standards before suggesting construction. A model is only one line of evidence; physical tests and responsible engineering judgment remain necessary.

# U03-L02 — Grashof condition and mechanism type

**Unit 3: Four-Bar and Slider-Crank Mechanisms · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** Which link-length sets permit continuous rotation of at least one link relative to the ground?

**Scenario:** A small mixer must allow a crank to turn fully without disassembling a four-bar. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `s+l≤p+q is the planar Grashof criterion`.

At equality the change-point mechanism needs special attention; assembly mode and link fixed to ground determine crank-rocker behavior. Draw the fixed pivots and input crank before solving unknown links. The law of cosines can give the same assembly angle as a vector-closure solution, but quadrant choice and branch tracking remain essential. A continuous physical mechanism normally follows one solution branch until constrained by contact or an exceptional configuration. For slider-crank geometry, exact rod obliquity distinguishes motion from the sinusoidal long-rod approximation. In a four-bar, Grashof geometry indicates potential rotations only with a specified inversion. A transmission angle near an undesirable extreme can increase joint force for the same useful output even when the mathematical displacement remains smooth.

Define each independent quantity and units before substitution. If a formula contains an angle derivative, convert degrees to radians and apply the chain rule to move from angle to time. For a constrained mechanism, first solve position closure and then differentiate to obtain velocity and acceleration. For a loaded mechanism, separate the purely kinematic result from required contact reactions and input torque. Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Sorted link lengths s=0.10, p=0.14, q=0.18, l=0.20 m.

**Calculation — Grashof margin p+q−s−l:** **0.02 m**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Believing the Grashof criterion guarantees a specific grounded link can rotate in every inversion.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Ground a different link without changing link lengths and reconsider which link is permitted full rotation. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement. Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Build two sets of links, one satisfying and one violating the criterion, then record attainable motion. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely. Keep synthetic values separated from measured observations, and do not count the same input data as independent validation.

The report should contain a labeled schematic, equations, raw input table, one calculated output and its units, a sensitivity result and a discrepancy explanation.

# U03-L03 — Four-bar transmission angle

**Unit 3: Four-Bar and Slider-Crank Mechanisms · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** Why can a linkage have acceptable motion but poor force transmission?

**Scenario:** A toggle clamp approaches an aligned configuration and mechanical advantage changes rapidly. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `μ is the angle between coupler and output rocker`.

The transmission angle indicates useful force direction but does not alone encode friction, inertia or input torque variation. Draw the fixed pivots and input crank before solving unknown links. The law of cosines can give the same assembly angle as a vector-closure solution, but quadrant choice and branch tracking remain essential. A continuous physical mechanism normally follows one solution branch until constrained by contact or an exceptional configuration. For slider-crank geometry, exact rod obliquity distinguishes motion from the sinusoidal long-rod approximation. In a four-bar, Grashof geometry indicates potential rotations only with a specified inversion. A transmission angle near an undesirable extreme can increase joint force for the same useful output even when the mathematical displacement remains smooth.

For a constrained mechanism, first solve position closure and then differentiate to obtain velocity and acceleration. For a loaded mechanism, separate the purely kinematic result from required contact reactions and input torque. Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** A 120 N coupler force acts at 40 degrees to output rocker; useful transverse component only.

**Calculation — Ideal output tangential force:** **77.1345 N**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Using favorable displacement ratio as proof of low joint load.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Move the coupler–rocker transmission angle toward zero and identify the force component that no longer contributes to useful output moment. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement. Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Measure input force as the output link passes through different transmission angles. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely.

# U03-L04 — Slider-crank position analysis

**Unit 3: Four-Bar and Slider-Crank Mechanisms · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** How do crank angle and rod ratio determine piston position?

**Scenario:** A compact pump must achieve a defined stroke inside a short housing. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `x=r cosθ+sqrt(l²−r²sin²θ)`.

The square-root branch shown assumes an in-line slider-crank and l greater than r; offset or crossed configurations need separate equations. Draw the fixed pivots and input crank before solving unknown links. The law of cosines can give the same assembly angle as a vector-closure solution, but quadrant choice and branch tracking remain essential. A continuous physical mechanism normally follows one solution branch until constrained by contact or an exceptional configuration. For slider-crank geometry, exact rod obliquity distinguishes motion from the sinusoidal long-rod approximation. In a four-bar, Grashof geometry indicates potential rotations only with a specified inversion.

A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Crank r=0.05 m, rod l=0.18 m, crank angle 60 degrees; in-line slider.

**Calculation — Slider position from axis:** **0.199714 m**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path.

Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Using the simple harmonic approximation as exact when rod length is not large compared with crank radius.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Make the connecting rod very long relative to the crank and demonstrate the convergence toward the approximate simple harmonic position. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement.

Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Compare exact position with x≈l+r cosθ at rod ratios of two and five. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely.

# U03-L05 — Slider-crank velocity and acceleration

**Unit 3: Four-Bar and Slider-Crank Mechanisms · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** Why do peak piston accelerations occur at different angles from peak velocity?

**Scenario:** A reciprocating compressor has a nominally uniform rotating crank but nonuniform reciprocating inertial loading. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `v=dx/dt and a=d²x/dt²`.

Differentiating a noisy position measurement twice amplifies noise; smooth only with a documented method and compare analytical derivatives. Draw the fixed pivots and input crank before solving unknown links. The law of cosines can give the same assembly angle as a vector-closure solution, but quadrant choice and branch tracking remain essential. A continuous physical mechanism normally follows one solution branch until constrained by contact or an exceptional configuration. For slider-crank geometry, exact rod obliquity distinguishes motion from the sinusoidal long-rod approximation. In a four-bar, Grashof geometry indicates potential rotations only with a specified inversion. A transmission angle near an undesirable extreme can increase joint force for the same useful output even when the mathematical displacement remains smooth.

For a loaded mechanism, separate the purely kinematic result from required contact reactions and input torque. Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Stroke 2r=0.10 m; crank speed 900 rpm; mean absolute piston speed 2 stroke n/60.

**Calculation — Piston mean speed:** **3 m/s**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Assuming piston velocity is a sinusoid with no finite-rod correction.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Change crank speed while maintaining the same geometric crank path. Position does not depend on speed, while velocity scales once and acceleration approximately twice in the exponent. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement. Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Differentiate the exact position numerically at sufficiently small time steps and check convergence. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely. Keep synthetic values separated from measured observations, and do not count the same input data as independent validation.
