# U04-L01 — Fundamental gear speed ratio

**Unit 4: Gears, Belts and Power Transmission · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** What sets the speed and direction of a meshing gear pair?

**Scenario:** A 20-tooth pinion drives a 60-tooth external spur gear on an adjacent shaft. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `ω2/ω1=−z1/z2 for external spur gears`.

Ideal pure rolling at the pitch circles fixes the ratio; real backlash and contact compliance cause small transient deviations. Begin with pitch-line motion and the sign of angular velocity. In external gearing, adjacent gears rotate in opposite directions and the speed magnitude is inverse to tooth count. In a two-stage train, multiply each individual signed ratio and keep a diagram showing shaft identities. Torque can increase as speed decreases while ideal power remains constant; a gearbox cannot create net energy. A real drive introduces friction, backlash, belt creep, bearing losses, heat, vibration and fatigue. If a belt is used, define pitch diameters rather than arbitrary outside diameters. If a chain is used, recognize the polygonal path of discrete pins and possible speed ripple.

Define each independent quantity and units before substitution. If a formula contains an angle derivative, convert degrees to radians and apply the chain rule to move from angle to time. For a constrained mechanism, first solve position closure and then differentiate to obtain velocity and acceleration. For a loaded mechanism, separate the purely kinematic result from required contact reactions and input torque. Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** External gears with input speed 1200 rpm, pinion 20 teeth, wheel 60 teeth.

**Calculation — External gear output speed:** **-400 rpm**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Confusing tooth-count ratio with the torque ratio and forgetting direction reversal.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Add one external idler gear between driver and output. Explain which rotation direction changes and why the overall ratio magnitude can remain the same. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement. Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Count teeth on a bench rig and compare shaft tachometer readings. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely. Keep synthetic values separated from measured observations, and do not count the same input data as independent validation.

The report should contain a labeled schematic, equations, raw input table, one calculated output and its units, a sensitivity result and a discrepancy explanation. If an observed path differs from the model, consider perspective error, misidentified joints, slippage, structural flexibility, bearing clearance and unintended motion. Decide which extra measurement would distinguish the most plausible causes. A useful verification plan explains not only what evidence would support a model but what evidence would require it to be revised.

## Exercises and assessment

1. **Numerical variation:** Recalculate the worked example after changing one driving parameter by 15%. State the new answer, its units and the percentage change. Identify any hidden domain restriction, such as a minimum rod length or positive stiffness.
2. **Mechanism reasoning:** What sets the speed and direction of a meshing gear pair? Contrast the original situation with a changed link, joint, contact condition or speed regime. Draw the new physical picture and explain which equation remains valid, requires modification or fails.
3. **Model critique:** Design an independent test for the proposed investigation, including measured variables, instrument calibration, repeatability, one confounding factor and a rejection criterion.

## Design review conclusion

**Fundamental gear speed ratio** provides one part of a complete machine analysis. Deliver a brief calculation memo with an explicit operating range and at least one technical limitation. Evaluate the result against mechanism geometry and energy conservation, and list any unresolved requirements for guards, rated components, fatigue testing, maintenance or industrial standards before suggesting construction. A model is only one line of evidence; physical tests and responsible engineering judgment remain necessary.

# U04-L02 — Gear module and pitch geometry

**Unit 4: Gears, Belts and Power Transmission · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** Why must gears with different tooth counts still have matching pitch?

**Scenario:** Two replaceable gears are required to fit the same shaft centers and mesh correctly. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `d=mz for standard metric spur gears`.

Standard pressure angle, helix angle, addendum and tooth profile also affect compatibility; module alone is not sufficient. Begin with pitch-line motion and the sign of angular velocity. In external gearing, adjacent gears rotate in opposite directions and the speed magnitude is inverse to tooth count. In a two-stage train, multiply each individual signed ratio and keep a diagram showing shaft identities. Torque can increase as speed decreases while ideal power remains constant; a gearbox cannot create net energy. A real drive introduces friction, backlash, belt creep, bearing losses, heat, vibration and fatigue. If a belt is used, define pitch diameters rather than arbitrary outside diameters.

For a loaded mechanism, separate the purely kinematic result from required contact reactions and input torque. Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Module 2.5 mm and 36 teeth; compatible involute gear assumed.

**Calculation — Metric pitch diameter:** **90 mm**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Mixing diametral pitch in inverse inches with metric module in millimetres.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Hold tooth count fixed while changing module. Track the new pitch diameter and required center distance before choosing an actual gear pair. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

A result matters when it can influence an engineering decision: mechanism selection, operating speed, joint configuration, allowable tolerance or actuator requirement. Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Measure pitch diameter and divide by tooth count across a compatible gear set. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely.

# U04-L03 — Gear torque and shaft power

**Unit 4: Gears, Belts and Power Transmission · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** How does the same power appear as high speed–low torque or low speed–high torque?

**Scenario:** A reducer trades an input of 1800 rpm for higher output torque at a lower speed. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `P=Tω, with ω=2πn/60`.

The ideal ratio ignores mesh and bearing losses; measured efficiency must be a ratio of output to input power for the same time interval. Begin with pitch-line motion and the sign of angular velocity. In external gearing, adjacent gears rotate in opposite directions and the speed magnitude is inverse to tooth count. In a two-stage train, multiply each individual signed ratio and keep a diagram showing shaft identities. Torque can increase as speed decreases while ideal power remains constant; a gearbox cannot create net energy. A real drive introduces friction, backlash, belt creep, bearing losses, heat, vibration and fatigue. If a belt is used, define pitch diameters rather than arbitrary outside diameters.

Identify when the formula assumes a fixed pivot, a constant input speed, a continuously engaged contact, or one assembly branch. A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Torque 16 N·m; speed 900 revolutions per minute.

**Calculation — Shaft power:** **1,507.96 W**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path.

Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Claiming that a transmission multiplies mechanical power without input energy.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Increase output torque through a reducer and account for a non-unity efficiency. Determine whether the input power stays adequate. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Use a dynamometer and tachometer to compare input and output power. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely.

# U04-L04 — Belt and pulley kinematics

**Unit 4: Gears, Belts and Power Transmission · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** What changes when a belt stretches or slips under load?

**Scenario:** A fan uses a 75 mm driver pulley and 150 mm driven pulley. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `n2≈n1D1/D2 under ideal no-slip conditions`.

Belt speed and pulley speed agree only when slip and creep are negligible; wrap angle affects traction capacity. Begin with pitch-line motion and the sign of angular velocity. In external gearing, adjacent gears rotate in opposite directions and the speed magnitude is inverse to tooth count. In a two-stage train, multiply each individual signed ratio and keep a diagram showing shaft identities. Torque can increase as speed decreases while ideal power remains constant; a gearbox cannot create net energy. A real drive introduces friction, backlash, belt creep, bearing losses, heat, vibration and fatigue. If a belt is used, define pitch diameters rather than arbitrary outside diameters.

A physically meaningful calculation states its domain, not just its output.

## Worked numerical case

**Illustrative inputs:** Driver 1200 rpm; pitch diameters 75 and 150 mm.

**Calculation — No-slip driven pulley speed:** **600 rpm**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path. When it is a geometric dimension, check the assembly envelope and the full intended motion cycle, not only the illustrated pose.

**Sanity test:** Vary one relevant parameter by 10% and classify the resulting trend as linear, inverse, quadratic or configuration-dependent. Consider a near-limit case and ask which assumption would fail first. The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Using geometric diameters without recognizing effective pitch radius and belt slip.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Allow three percent belt slip and show how the measured output speed falls below the no-slip geometric estimate. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Mark both pulleys and the belt, then compare observed revolutions. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls.

# U04-L05 — Chains, sprockets and tension

**Unit 4: Gears, Belts and Power Transmission · University-level learning draft · All examples synthetic**

## Engineering question and geometry

**Question:** Why can chain drives show speed ripple despite a fixed average ratio?

**Scenario:** A compact conveyor drive uses small-tooth-count sprockets and experiences chordal action. Begin by drawing the machine in one reference configuration, identifying the ground, the input actuator and the intended output variable. Treat the device as a rigid planar assembly only if its geometry and operating conditions justify that approximation. Mark fixed points, moving joints, relevant dimensions, motion signs and any physical stop or contact condition. A computer animation is useful for communicating the proposed motion, but it cannot demonstrate that the physical parts have sufficient clearance or that the arrangement is safe.

## Principle, constraints and derivation

**Governing relation:** `v=p z n/60 for chain pitch p and sprocket teeth z`.

A chain pitch is the distance between adjacent pins; actual capacity depends on speed, lubrication, alignment and load spectrum. Begin with pitch-line motion and the sign of angular velocity. In external gearing, adjacent gears rotate in opposite directions and the speed magnitude is inverse to tooth count. In a two-stage train, multiply each individual signed ratio and keep a diagram showing shaft identities. Torque can increase as speed decreases while ideal power remains constant; a gearbox cannot create net energy. A real drive introduces friction, backlash, belt creep, bearing losses, heat, vibration and fatigue. If a belt is used, define pitch diameters rather than arbitrary outside diameters.

**Illustrative inputs:** Chain pitch 12.7 mm, 18 tooth sprocket, 240 rpm.

**Calculation — Ideal chain speed:** **0.9144 m/s**. These values were chosen for teaching, not measured from machinery. Put each input and its unit on a separate line in a reproducible calculation sheet, then verify the arithmetic with an independent computation. The sign of a rotational quantity indicates orientation; it does not imply an error. When the output is a force, check the implied work and reaction path.

The calculation cannot independently prove its own assumptions: a derived value must eventually be compared with a separate observation, compatible published reference or physically grounded second model.

## Engineering interpretation and counterexample

**Frequent mistake:** Treating chain links as a continuous smooth belt with no polygonal action.

**Specific sensitivity investigation:** Replace a large sprocket with a very small one and discuss the qualitative change in polygonal action, fatigue and noise. State what is held fixed, what changes and whether the output should be continuous. For closed-loop linkages, a second numerical solution may correspond to a different assembly branch; continuous angle tracking and a small closure residual are essential. For cams, belts, transmissions and vibration models, identify contact state, speed range and sources of energy dissipation. If a model produces exceptionally high speed or force near an ideal singularity, report the sensitivity and stop short of treating an unbounded prediction as achievable hardware performance.

Always distinguish theoretical feasibility from reliability over many cycles. Geometry can be correct while friction, wear, fatigue, excessive contact stress or dynamic instability invalidates the design. A response that is numerically precise but sensitive to unmeasured clearances should be given as a qualified estimate rather than a certified value.

## Test and reproducibility plan

**Investigation:** Record pitch progression per shaft turn and observe cyclic velocity fluctuation. Record the drawing and initial settings before running the test. An appropriate student exercise can use slow, guarded motion, video tracking, or a separate numerical implementation; an energized high-speed experiment needs professional safety controls. Document reference length, sampling interval, calibration method and expected uncertainty. Compare at least three configurations, including a near-boundary case if it can be studied safely.
