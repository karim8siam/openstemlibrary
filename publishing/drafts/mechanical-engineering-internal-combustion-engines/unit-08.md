# Internal Combustion Engines — U08-L01


## U08-L01 — Hydrogen and oxygenated-fuel engine fundamentals

**Learning target.** At the end of this lesson, a reader should interpret the governing relation, reproduce a worked estimate, identify the limiting assumption and plan an independent verification of the engineering claim.

### 1. Physical question and context

A defensible treatment of **hydrogen and oxygenated-fuel engine fundamentals** begins by separating observable behavior from explanatory mechanism. Fuel chemistry changes ignition limits, storage, injection strategy and emissions pathways. In an internal combustion engine this distinction is especially important because the same output can be produced by changes in fueling, volumetric efficiency, combustion phase, wall heat transfer or mechanical loss. The lesson therefore treats a compact formula as a hypothesis to be tested, not as an exact engine description.

### 2. Governing calculation and its domain

Use `A consistent energy comparison is chemical input = fuel mass * specified lower heating value.` as the initial closure relation. It is tempting to interpret the number as a design guarantee; instead define a reference operating point, perturb each independent input separately and observe the output response. Check whether apparently independent variables are actually correlated by conservation or control logic. Treat a high-sensitivity variable as a candidate for better measurement. If the result requires a parameter measured by the same output that is being predicted, the model is partly circular and its validation requires an independent observation.

**Assumed numerical case:** At 0.010 kg of fuel with assumed LHV 120 MJ/kg, input is 1.2 MJ before conversion losses.

**Calculation walkthrough:** With an assumed lower heating value of 120 MJ/kg and fuel mass 0.010 kg, the chemical input is 120×0.010 = 1.2 MJ. This is not the amount of brake work: conversion efficiency and storage auxiliaries remain. The assumed LHV should never be interpreted as a property value that applies to all fuel blends or storage conditions.

The stated values form a hypothetical teaching example and should be recalculated by hand. First write the governing relation, then translate the inputs to SI, then perform substitution before rounding the displayed output. Check the sign and order of magnitude against a physical limiting case. Finally, ask which measured input would dominate an uncertainty interval. A large discrepancy from an independently computed check is grounds to revise the work, not to adjust the accepted answer without explanation.

### 3. Interpret the result, including failures

**Critical interpretation:** Hydrogen operation can still form thermal NOx in air and requires stringent leak management. A misleading numerical result can arise even when the arithmetic is perfect: the problem may be a wrong system boundary, an inappropriate reference property, a time-averaged signal used for a crank-angle event, or an unrecorded controller response. State which of those failure mechanisms is most likely here. Think about the change that would be observed in cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, manifold state, or brake output if the explanatory mechanism were genuinely active rather than merely correlated with an unrelated change.

**Conservation audit:** Start by marking the system boundary on a sketch. Separate fuel energy entering the cylinder from indicated work on the piston and brake work at the shaft. A computed improvement that violates energy conservation is a mistake, not a new engine phenomenon. Where an experimental result seems to contradict the calculation, investigate calibration, hidden storage, auxiliary loads and the interpretation of reference conditions before adding complexity to the model. Applied to **hydrogen and oxygenated-fuel engine fundamentals**, this discipline helps decide whether the model is a prediction with independent evidence or merely a restatement of its input measurements. Write the most restrictive assumption in the margin of the calculation, then revise the interpretation if that assumption fails under the case-study operating conditions.

### 4. Measurement, uncertainty and experimental integrity

**Measurement and evidence plan:** Use documented fuel properties, containment reviews and protected lab protocols. Before any data are collected, define a consistent sample clock, an equipment configuration record and at least one repeated baseline run. Identify how the instrument is calibrated and what its resolution excludes. Put all conversions in the analysis code rather than transcribing rounded values manually. Where the quantity is derived from several measurements, propagate uncertainty through the formula or use an appropriate perturbation study. A graph should show its reference conditions and measurement units. Unsupported interpolation between sparse engine-map points is not experimental evidence.

**Time dependence:** Engines operate through rapid events and slowly changing component states simultaneously. A crank-angle snapshot can describe the valve position but not warm-up; an averaged steady flow can describe laboratory demand but hide combustion variability. State the time scale to which each measured quantity belongs before comparing it with a model prediction. A careful research report can hold two ideas at once: the simplified result is internally correct and it is insufficient for system approval. This is not a weakness of mathematical modeling; it is the reason engineering uses progressive verification against measurements.

### 5. Engineering decision and integration

**Design implication:** Compare full system losses and safety requirements rather than only tailpipe CO2. This lesson addresses only one component of the unit's problem: A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen. Changes that look beneficial locally can increase pumping loss, friction, catalyst warm-up time, thermal stress or control complexity elsewhere. Accordingly, the correct engineering decision requires a second comparison at an off-design state and a list of constraints that cannot be traded away. The next simulation or experiment should be chosen to resolve the most consequential unknown, not simply to make the improvement look larger.

A useful extension is to reverse the calculation: choose an output target, estimate the input it would require and then test whether the implied operating point satisfies the engine's load, temperature, fuel and emissions constraints. Reverse calculations frequently uncover impossible combinations that are obscured by forward examples. Record the result as a conditional design feasibility statement, not a claim of guaranteed machine performance.

### 6. Practice and assessment

1. **Conceptual:** Explain why the relation `A consistent energy comparison is chemical input = fuel mass * specified lower heating value.` is meaningful for this lesson. Name two necessary assumptions and a physical regime in which one fails.
2. **Calculation:** Reproduce and verify the worked case: At 0.010 kg of fuel with assumed LHV 120 MJ/kg, input is 1.2 MJ before conversion losses. Show units at every intermediate stage and carry at least one input uncertainty through the output.
3. **Diagnostic:** A team reports a performance improvement after changing one input. Construct an alternative explanation using a measurement error, thermal shift or controller response. What single observation would discriminate between them?
4. **Design:** In the case “A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen.”, propose one legitimate design change and one nonnegotiable constraint. Compare full system losses and safety requirements rather than only tailpipe CO2.
5. **Research practice:** Give a file naming and metadata convention that would allow another student to reproduce the analysis, including configuration, units and calibration state.

**Worked-answer checking guide.** For question 2, the reference result is described in the assumed numerical case; a correct submission must also specify the formula, the explicit units and the idealizations. For question 3, credit is earned for a falsifiable alternative mechanism and a measurement that can separate it from the original claim. For question 4, a design that ignores the nonnegotiable constraint is rejected even if its calculated objective improves.

**Further investigation.** Repeat the reasoning at two additional operating points: lower speed and higher intake temperature, or cold start and warmed-up operation where relevant. Describe why the same input perturbation might have a different result under those conditions. Decide which hypothesis can be evaluated safely using the offline numerical model and which requires qualified laboratory equipment.

# Internal Combustion Engines — U08-L02


## U08-L02 — Hybrid powertrains and engine operating points

**Learning target.** At the end of this lesson, a reader should interpret the governing relation, reproduce a worked estimate, identify the limiting assumption and plan an independent verification of the engineering claim.

### 1. Physical question and context

Begin with the question of what can legitimately be inferred about **hybrid powertrains and engine operating points** from a few laboratory numbers. Hybridization can move engine operation toward efficient regions while introducing electric conversion losses. The distinction between a physical quantity and a convenient proxy matters because an engine is simultaneously a chemical reactor, a flow machine, a heat exchanger and an oscillating mechanism. A simple classroom calculation is useful when it makes this distinction precise. It becomes dangerous to reasoning when its hidden assumptions are forgotten.

### 2. Governing calculation and its domain

The working relation used here is `Total battery energy change = integral electrical power into battery dt with specified sign.`. Define every variable before substitution, keep a single system of units, and check whether its result should increase or decrease when an input changes. Ask which assumptions make the expression possible: steady conditions, a perfect gas, constant properties, a lumped state, negligible pressure loss or an ideal mechanical linkage may be necessary. If an assumption does not hold in the intended application, identify the direction of the expected deviation when physics permits. When that direction is not clear, do not guess; schedule a measurement or use a higher-fidelity calculation.

**Assumed numerical case:** If a pack supplies 5 kW for 0.2 h ideally, delivered electrical energy is 1 kWh.

**Calculation walkthrough:** A battery delivering 5 kW for 0.2 hour transfers 5×0.2 = 1 kWh before considering electric conversion and thermal losses. If a hybrid drive begins at high state of charge and ends substantially lower, attributing all delivered shaft work to fuel alone would misstate the comparison. Use an energy-equivalent state-of-charge correction.

The stated values form a hypothetical teaching example and should be recalculated by hand. First write the governing relation, then translate the inputs to SI, then perform substitution before rounding the displayed output. Check the sign and order of magnitude against a physical limiting case. Finally, ask which measured input would dominate an uncertainty interval. A large discrepancy from an independently computed check is grounds to revise the work, not to adjust the accepted answer without explanation.

### 3. Interpret the result, including failures

**Critical interpretation:** Charge-sustaining comparisons require end-state-of-charge correction and route controls. A misleading numerical result can arise even when the arithmetic is perfect: the problem may be a wrong system boundary, an inappropriate reference property, a time-averaged signal used for a crank-angle event, or an unrecorded controller response. State which of those failure mechanisms is most likely here. Think about the change that would be observed in cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, manifold state, or brake output if the explanatory mechanism were genuinely active rather than merely correlated with an unrelated change.

**Scale and sensitivity:** Scaling a geometric or thermal parameter is not a free performance gain. With every scale change, ask which transport time, stress, temperature, pressure ratio or nondimensional group changes with it. If the underlying response is nonlinear, quote a local sensitivity around the stated operating point instead of applying a single proportional rule across an engine map. Applied to **hybrid powertrains and engine operating points**, this discipline helps decide whether the model is a prediction with independent evidence or merely a restatement of its input measurements. Write the most restrictive assumption in the margin of the calculation, then revise the interpretation if that assumption fails under the case-study operating conditions.

### 4. Measurement, uncertainty and experimental integrity

**Measurement and evidence plan:** Analyze engine map, battery energy and accessory loads across an identical duty cycle. Before any data are collected, define a consistent sample clock, an equipment configuration record and at least one repeated baseline run. Identify how the instrument is calibrated and what its resolution excludes. Put all conversions in the analysis code rather than transcribing rounded values manually. Where the quantity is derived from several measurements, propagate uncertainty through the formula or use an appropriate perturbation study. A graph should show its reference conditions and measurement units. Unsupported interpolation between sparse engine-map points is not experimental evidence.

**Experimental identifiability:** A neat equation does not imply that each parameter can be determined from available measurements. Two unknown effects may create the same measured output, especially when only torque and speed are logged. Design an independent measurement that distinguishes the competing explanations; when this is impossible, report a bounded family of plausible parameter values rather than a falsely precise single answer. A careful research report can hold two ideas at once: the simplified result is internally correct and it is insufficient for system approval. This is not a weakness of mathematical modeling; it is the reason engineering uses progressive verification against measurements.

### 5. Engineering decision and integration

**Design implication:** Do not count stored electricity as free energy. This lesson addresses only one component of the unit's problem: A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen. Changes that look beneficial locally can increase pumping loss, friction, catalyst warm-up time, thermal stress or control complexity elsewhere. Accordingly, the correct engineering decision requires a second comparison at an off-design state and a list of constraints that cannot be traded away. The next simulation or experiment should be chosen to resolve the most consequential unknown, not simply to make the improvement look larger.

# Internal Combustion Engines — U08-L03


## U08-L03 — Waste-heat recovery and combined heat and power

**Learning target.** At the end of this lesson, a reader should interpret the governing relation, reproduce a worked estimate, identify the limiting assumption and plan an independent verification of the engineering claim.

### 1. Physical question and context

Consider an engineer who is evaluating **waste-heat recovery and combined heat and power** in the following setting: A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen. The analytical priority is not to maximize the number of equations. It is to identify the correct conserved quantity, select a boundary and state the outcome that the instrument or simulation actually reports. Recoverable exhaust and coolant heat must match a genuine useful demand and practical temperature level. Two measurements that share a unit may still refer to different control volumes, time windows or reference states.

### 2. Governing calculation and its domain

The smallest useful model is `CHP utilization = (useful electric output + useful recovered heat)/fuel input on a common energy basis.`. Write it first in symbols because symbols expose which quantities are inputs and which are derived. Conduct a dimensional check. For example, an energy rate must have dimensions of power, and a dimensionless efficiency must not quietly carry a pressure unit. Then inspect the limiting cases. A vanishing input, a zero flow or an impossible temperature ratio should trigger a validity warning rather than a numerically polished answer. The equation belongs to the assumptions stated with it, not to every engine.

**Assumed numerical case:** For 100 kW fuel input, 32 kW electric and 40 kW useful heat, utilization is 72%.

**Calculation walkthrough:** For fuel input 100 kW, useful electric output 32 kW and useful heat delivered 40 kW, combined utilization is (32+40)/100 = 72%. The uncounted 28 kW includes losses in this simplified boundary. Heat dumped to the environment is not useful heat, regardless of whether a thermal exchanger could theoretically intercept it.

The stated values form a hypothetical teaching example and should be recalculated by hand. First write the governing relation, then translate the inputs to SI, then perform substitution before rounding the displayed output. Check the sign and order of magnitude against a physical limiting case. Finally, ask which measured input would dominate an uncertainty interval. A large discrepancy from an independently computed check is grounds to revise the work, not to adjust the accepted answer without explanation.

### 3. Interpret the result, including failures

**Critical interpretation:** Counting heat with no useful demand inflates performance; temperature quality matters. A misleading numerical result can arise even when the arithmetic is perfect: the problem may be a wrong system boundary, an inappropriate reference property, a time-averaged signal used for a crank-angle event, or an unrecorded controller response. State which of those failure mechanisms is most likely here. Think about the change that would be observed in cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, manifold state, or brake output if the explanatory mechanism were genuinely active rather than merely correlated with an unrelated change.

**Time dependence:** Engines operate through rapid events and slowly changing component states simultaneously. A crank-angle snapshot can describe the valve position but not warm-up; an averaged steady flow can describe laboratory demand but hide combustion variability. State the time scale to which each measured quantity belongs before comparing it with a model prediction. Applied to **waste-heat recovery and combined heat and power**, this discipline helps decide whether the model is a prediction with independent evidence or merely a restatement of its input measurements. Write the most restrictive assumption in the margin of the calculation, then revise the interpretation if that assumption fails under the case-study operating conditions.

### 4. Measurement, uncertainty and experimental integrity

**Measurement and evidence plan:** Meter actual heat delivered to the end user, not theoretical exhaust heat availability. Before any data are collected, define a consistent sample clock, an equipment configuration record and at least one repeated baseline run. Identify how the instrument is calibrated and what its resolution excludes. Put all conversions in the analysis code rather than transcribing rounded values manually. Where the quantity is derived from several measurements, propagate uncertainty through the formula or use an appropriate perturbation study. A graph should show its reference conditions and measurement units. Unsupported interpolation between sparse engine-map points is not experimental evidence.

**Operating-envelope reasoning:** Any model can look successful at its calibration point. The meaningful question is whether its error stays acceptably small at cold start, hot idle, high load, low ambient pressure, and during rapid change. Define this intended envelope explicitly, keep data from some points for validation, and reject extrapolation outside known physical or measurement limits. A careful research report can hold two ideas at once: the simplified result is internally correct and it is insufficient for system approval. This is not a weakness of mathematical modeling; it is the reason engineering uses progressive verification against measurements.

### 5. Engineering decision and integration

**Design implication:** Match load profiles and maintenance economics before adding heat-recovery equipment. This lesson addresses only one component of the unit's problem: A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen. Changes that look beneficial locally can increase pumping loss, friction, catalyst warm-up time, thermal stress or control complexity elsewhere. Accordingly, the correct engineering decision requires a second comparison at an off-design state and a list of constraints that cannot be traded away. The next simulation or experiment should be chosen to resolve the most consequential unknown, not simply to make the improvement look larger.

A useful extension is to reverse the calculation: choose an output target, estimate the input it would require and then test whether the implied operating point satisfies the engine's load, temperature, fuel and emissions constraints. Reverse calculations frequently uncover impossible combinations that are obscured by forward examples. Record the result as a conditional design feasibility statement, not a claim of guaranteed machine performance.

# Internal Combustion Engines — U08-L04


## U08-L04 — Engine selection under lifecycle and duty constraints

**Learning target.** At the end of this lesson, a reader should interpret the governing relation, reproduce a worked estimate, identify the limiting assumption and plan an independent verification of the engineering claim.

### 1. Physical question and context

The central issue in **engine selection under lifecycle and duty constraints** is not memorizing a formula but knowing when its use is justified. An optimal laboratory efficiency point may not match starts, idling, maintenance or fuel logistics. A model's apparent precision depends on measurement resolution, parameter provenance and the operating envelope. At the outset specify whether a statement refers to a single cylinder, all cylinders, indicated work, brake shaft work, intake flow or exhaust flow. Changing that definition silently can invalidate a numerical answer while leaving its arithmetic flawless.

### 2. Governing calculation and its domain

Use `Annual fuel cost = annual chemical energy demand / average efficiency * fuel price per energy unit.` as the initial closure relation. It is tempting to interpret the number as a design guarantee; instead define a reference operating point, perturb each independent input separately and observe the output response. Check whether apparently independent variables are actually correlated by conservation or control logic. Treat a high-sensitivity variable as a candidate for better measurement. If the result requires a parameter measured by the same output that is being predicted, the model is partly circular and its validation requires an independent observation.

**Assumed numerical case:** A 100 MWh/year shaft demand at 30% average brake efficiency requires about 333 MWh fuel energy.

**Calculation walkthrough:** A yearly shaft energy requirement of 100 MWh at average brake efficiency 0.30 implies chemical fuel energy = 100/0.30 = 333.3 MWh. A peak-efficiency estimate of 0.40 would instead imply 250 MWh and understate expected consumption if typical operation is inefficient. Always apply a duty-weighted, physically justified efficiency.

The stated values form a hypothetical teaching example and should be recalculated by hand. First write the governing relation, then translate the inputs to SI, then perform substitution before rounding the displayed output. Check the sign and order of magnitude against a physical limiting case. Finally, ask which measured input would dominate an uncertainty interval. A large discrepancy from an independently computed check is grounds to revise the work, not to adjust the accepted answer without explanation.

### 3. Interpret the result, including failures

**Critical interpretation:** Start/stop, ambient temperature and degradation make a single map-point extrapolation weak. A misleading numerical result can arise even when the arithmetic is perfect: the problem may be a wrong system boundary, an inappropriate reference property, a time-averaged signal used for a crank-angle event, or an unrecorded controller response. State which of those failure mechanisms is most likely here. Think about the change that would be observed in cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, manifold state, or brake output if the explanatory mechanism were genuinely active rather than merely correlated with an unrelated change.

**Experimental identifiability:** A neat equation does not imply that each parameter can be determined from available measurements. Two unknown effects may create the same measured output, especially when only torque and speed are logged. Design an independent measurement that distinguishes the competing explanations; when this is impossible, report a bounded family of plausible parameter values rather than a falsely precise single answer. Applied to **engine selection under lifecycle and duty constraints**, this discipline helps decide whether the model is a prediction with independent evidence or merely a restatement of its input measurements. Write the most restrictive assumption in the margin of the calculation, then revise the interpretation if that assumption fails under the case-study operating conditions.

### 4. Measurement, uncertainty and experimental integrity

**Measurement and evidence plan:** Build a representative load-duration curve and scenario analyses with uncertainty. Before any data are collected, define a consistent sample clock, an equipment configuration record and at least one repeated baseline run. Identify how the instrument is calibrated and what its resolution excludes. Put all conversions in the analysis code rather than transcribing rounded values manually. Where the quantity is derived from several measurements, propagate uncertainty through the formula or use an appropriate perturbation study. A graph should show its reference conditions and measurement units. Unsupported interpolation between sparse engine-map points is not experimental evidence.

**Conservation audit:** Start by marking the system boundary on a sketch. Separate fuel energy entering the cylinder from indicated work on the piston and brake work at the shaft. A computed improvement that violates energy conservation is a mistake, not a new engine phenomenon. Where an experimental result seems to contradict the calculation, investigate calibration, hidden storage, auxiliary loads and the interpretation of reference conditions before adding complexity to the model. A careful research report can hold two ideas at once: the simplified result is internally correct and it is insufficient for system approval. This is not a weakness of mathematical modeling; it is the reason engineering uses progressive verification against measurements.

### 5. Engineering decision and integration

**Design implication:** Score alternatives against validated service needs, not one favorable demonstration. This lesson addresses only one component of the unit's problem: A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen. Changes that look beneficial locally can increase pumping loss, friction, catalyst warm-up time, thermal stress or control complexity elsewhere. Accordingly, the correct engineering decision requires a second comparison at an off-design state and a list of constraints that cannot be traded away.

# Internal Combustion Engines — U08-L05


## U08-L05 — Integrated calibration, verification and design review

**Learning target.** At the end of this lesson, a reader should interpret the governing relation, reproduce a worked estimate, identify the limiting assumption and plan an independent verification of the engineering claim.

### 1. Physical question and context

A defensible treatment of **integrated calibration, verification and design review** begins by separating observable behavior from explanatory mechanism. Engine integration means resolving conflicting objectives with transparent evidence and controlled engineering change. In an internal combustion engine this distinction is especially important because the same output can be produced by changes in fueling, volumetric efficiency, combustion phase, wall heat transfer or mechanical loss. The lesson therefore treats a compact formula as a hypothesis to be tested, not as an exact engine description.

### 2. Governing calculation and its domain

The working relation used here is `A simple weighted score S=sum(w_i*s_i) is a decision aid only when weights and units are explicit.`. Define every variable before substitution, keep a single system of units, and check whether its result should increase or decrease when an input changes. Ask which assumptions make the expression possible: steady conditions, a perfect gas, constant properties, a lumped state, negligible pressure loss or an ideal mechanical linkage may be necessary. If an assumption does not hold in the intended application, identify the direction of the expected deviation when physics permits. When that direction is not clear, do not guess; schedule a measurement or use a higher-fidelity calculation.

**Assumed numerical case:** Weights 0.4 economy, 0.35 durability and 0.25 emissions must sum to one before computing a composite.

**Calculation walkthrough:** For weights 0.40, 0.35 and 0.25, verify 0.40+0.35+0.25=1.00 before scoring. An alternative may score highly while breaching an emissions or machinery-safety limit; any mandatory limit must be tested as a pass/fail condition separately. A weighted score is then a secondary aid to compare only feasible candidate solutions.

The stated values form a hypothetical teaching example and should be recalculated by hand. First write the governing relation, then translate the inputs to SI, then perform substitution before rounding the displayed output. Check the sign and order of magnitude against a physical limiting case. Finally, ask which measured input would dominate an uncertainty interval. A large discrepancy from an independently computed check is grounds to revise the work, not to adjust the accepted answer without explanation.

### 3. Interpret the result, including failures

**Critical interpretation:** Weights can conceal hard constraints such as safety or legal limits that cannot be traded away. A misleading numerical result can arise even when the arithmetic is perfect: the problem may be a wrong system boundary, an inappropriate reference property, a time-averaged signal used for a crank-angle event, or an unrecorded controller response. State which of those failure mechanisms is most likely here. Think about the change that would be observed in cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, manifold state, or brake output if the explanatory mechanism were genuinely active rather than merely correlated with an unrelated change.

**Operating-envelope reasoning:** Any model can look successful at its calibration point. The meaningful question is whether its error stays acceptably small at cold start, hot idle, high load, low ambient pressure, and during rapid change. Define this intended envelope explicitly, keep data from some points for validation, and reject extrapolation outside known physical or measurement limits. Applied to **integrated calibration, verification and design review**, this discipline helps decide whether the model is a prediction with independent evidence or merely a restatement of its input measurements. Write the most restrictive assumption in the margin of the calculation, then revise the interpretation if that assumption fails under the case-study operating conditions.

### 4. Measurement, uncertainty and experimental integrity

**Measurement and evidence plan:** Maintain a requirements-to-evidence matrix, regression logs and independent reviewer signoffs. Before any data are collected, define a consistent sample clock, an equipment configuration record and at least one repeated baseline run. Identify how the instrument is calibrated and what its resolution excludes. Put all conversions in the analysis code rather than transcribing rounded values manually. Where the quantity is derived from several measurements, propagate uncertainty through the formula or use an appropriate perturbation study. A graph should show its reference conditions and measurement units. Unsupported interpolation between sparse engine-map points is not experimental evidence.

**Scale and sensitivity:** Scaling a geometric or thermal parameter is not a free performance gain. With every scale change, ask which transport time, stress, temperature, pressure ratio or nondimensional group changes with it. If the underlying response is nonlinear, quote a local sensitivity around the stated operating point instead of applying a single proportional rule across an engine map. A careful research report can hold two ideas at once: the simplified result is internally correct and it is insufficient for system approval. This is not a weakness of mathematical modeling; it is the reason engineering uses progressive verification against measurements.

**Design implication:** Treat any unverified constraint as a blocker, even if the aggregate score appears favorable. This lesson addresses only one component of the unit's problem: A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen. Changes that look beneficial locally can increase pumping loss, friction, catalyst warm-up time, thermal stress or control complexity elsewhere. Accordingly, the correct engineering decision requires a second comparison at an off-design state and a list of constraints that cannot be traded away. The next simulation or experiment should be chosen to resolve the most consequential unknown, not simply to make the improvement look larger.

A useful extension is to reverse the calculation: choose an output target, estimate the input it would require and then test whether the implied operating point satisfies the engine's load, temperature, fuel and emissions constraints. Reverse calculations frequently uncover impossible combinations that are obscured by forward examples. Record the result as a conditional design feasibility statement, not a claim of guaranteed machine performance.

### 6. Practice and assessment

1. **Conceptual:** Explain why the relation `A simple weighted score S=sum(w_i*s_i) is a decision aid only when weights and units are explicit.` is meaningful for this lesson. Name two necessary assumptions and a physical regime in which one fails.
2. **Calculation:** Reproduce and verify the worked case: Weights 0.4 economy, 0.35 durability and 0.25 emissions must sum to one before computing a composite. Show units at every intermediate stage and carry at least one input uncertainty through the output.
3. **Diagnostic:** A team reports a performance improvement after changing one input. Construct an alternative explanation using a measurement error, thermal shift or controller response. What single observation would discriminate between them?
4. **Design:** In the case “A university team selects a power unit for backup generation after comparing liquid fuels, hybridization and hydrogen.”, propose one legitimate design change and one nonnegotiable constraint. Treat any unverified constraint as a blocker, even if the aggregate score appears favorable.
5. **Research practice:** Give a file naming and metadata convention that would allow another student to reproduce the analysis, including configuration, units and calibration state.

**Worked-answer checking guide.** For question 2, the reference result is described in the assumed numerical case; a correct submission must also specify the formula, the explicit units and the idealizations. For question 3, credit is earned for a falsifiable alternative mechanism and a measurement that can separate it from the original claim. For question 4, a design that ignores the nonnegotiable constraint is rejected even if its calculated objective improves.

**Further investigation.** Repeat the reasoning at two additional operating points: lower speed and higher intake temperature, or cold start and warmed-up operation where relevant. Describe why the same input perturbation might have a different result under those conditions. Decide which hypothesis can be evaluated safely using the offline numerical model and which requires qualified laboratory equipment.
