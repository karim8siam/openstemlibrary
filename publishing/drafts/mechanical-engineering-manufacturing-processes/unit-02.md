# Unit 2 · Lesson 1: Casting routes and mold requirements

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **casting routes and mold requirements** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A pump casing contains an internal volute that requires removable cores. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

The unit-wide objective is: Analyze mold filling, feeding, shrinkage, defects and solidification using screening models with clearly bounded assumptions. The feature or material characteristic being produced must be connected to an end-use requirement. For example, a process may create nominal geometry but fail on microstructure, internal soundness, roughness, residual stress or long-term fatigue. These differences mean the correct question is not “Can this tool make the shape?” but “Can this qualified route repeatedly produce the required physical result, with documented uncertainty and acceptable cost?”

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Sand, permanent-mold and investment casting differ in mold reuse, section capability, finish and typical tooling economics. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation. These distinctions determine what a useful calculation can and cannot represent. A model is most valuable when each term refers to a real feature that could be measured independently.

For the running case, A pump casing contains an internal volute that requires removable cores. Form a sketch or process-flow diagram containing the workpiece, tool interfaces, material input, outgoing product, and likely rejection mechanisms. Label the direction of transport and the time order of operations. This clarifies what belongs to the model boundary and what belongs to a downstream process. The crucial engineering focus is **Draft, cores, yields and machining allowance**. If these variables are not controlled, two nominally identical workpieces can arrive at the next station with different properties, even if both match the outline drawing.

A good first approximation should be deliberately small. Record initial material state; select one dominant mechanism; identify a representative geometry or operating point; and list the effects left out. Do not silently replace a measured value by a catalog average, particularly when temperature, orientation, strain rate, contamination or humidity change the underlying behavior. Industrial material and machine data must come from a verified source for the actual equipment and stock condition. The examples in this draft are provided to teach reasoning, not to certify a manufactured product.

## Worked numerical screening calculation

**Study:** Maximum gross casting mass. The illustrative expression is `3.2/0.8` and its result is approximately **4 kg**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases. If this sign check contradicts the physical system, inspect the assumptions before increasing numerical precision. If a computation uses an empirical coefficient, state which process and material supplied it and which data would be needed to fit it. Here, the important qualification is: A specified mass yield of 80% excludes downstream inspection rejects.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls. If the formula is nonlinear, a 10% input change need not produce a 10% output change. Report at least one alternative route or parameter setting, and explain what evidence would justify choosing it. A spreadsheet or Python notebook should carry units in the headings, not merely in a paragraph after the calculation.

## Implementation sequence and shop-floor decisions

Start with the product's critical-to-quality features. Translate the service requirement into an inspection method, a documented tolerance or an experimentally defensible acceptance criterion. Choose a material specification and incoming material check. Next define a feasible setup: datum selection, tooling, fixture or containment, operating window, and operator-safety controls. Record the nominal inputs together with the allowable adjustment ranges and who may authorize process changes. A process plan that lists only machine names is incomplete; it says little about the actual transformation of material.

The second decision is whether to measure in-process, post-process or both. An in-process signal can provide fast feedback but may be only an indirect proxy for the finished feature. A final dimensional gauge can establish geometry yet miss subsurface defects, unfavorable microstructure and residual stress. Select evidence that is related to the failure mechanism, and define how measurements will be associated with lot, equipment, operator and material batch. The practical validation step for this particular topic is: Mark core prints, gating, machining stock and inspection datums on a section sketch.

The third decision concerns yield and variation. Separate startup rejects, stable-running defects, changeover losses and damage during handling. These categories imply different corrective action. If each rejected part has been recorded only as “bad,” useful information has already been discarded. Compare changes using matched material lots, measurement methods and operating conditions. Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** A finer nominal surface finish does not automatically mean a lower whole-part cost. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure. Document both the result and the unresolved evidence gap.

Compare this lesson with **the unit requirements** and anticipate **Mold filling and fluidity**. Manufacturing defects propagate between processes. An inaccurate incoming blank can distort a finishing result; a poor thermal history can make a later crack appear to originate in machining; a tooling error can be mistaken for a measurement problem. Thus, a good failure investigation follows the material history upstream and downstream instead of blaming the most visible final operation. Rework should be treated as a new manufacturing step with its own process record and acceptance criteria.

**Measurement challenge.** Write down the measuring instrument, calibration or reference check, sampling location, operator, environmental variables and repeatability requirement. A numerical result without a plausible uncertainty or measurement method is not sufficient evidence of capability. For destructive evaluation, identify how the tested coupon represents actual geometry and process history; a convenient coupon can be unrepresentative of the part's critical region.

## Guided exercises

1. Define the controlling assumptions in **casting routes and mold requirements** and decide which ones are measurable during the production run.
2. Rebuild the numerical case for **maximum gross casting mass** with one input changed by 15%; report the direction and physical meaning of the change.
3. For the situation “A pump casing contains an internal volute that requires removable cores.”, design a short acceptance test that could reveal the risk: A finer nominal surface finish does not automatically mean a lower whole-part cost.

For each answer, submit (a) a labeled drawing or process-flow diagram, (b) an equation with dimensions, (c) a paragraph that links the numerical result to physical behavior, and (d) a limitation or required measurement. An answer that contains only an arithmetic result is incomplete because it does not establish that the model applies to the proposed manufacturing case.

## Reflection and design review

Consider the following question: Which measurement would falsify the simplest version of the model? Give a plausible counterexample in which the simple estimate passes but the manufactured component still fails its function. Then propose a low-cost pilot test whose result would distinguish that counterexample from a correctly manufactured part. A second engineer should be able to reproduce the assumed calculation and understand why an acceptance decision was or was not made.

Finally prepare a short decision record. State whether the available evidence supports proceeding to prototype, indicates the need for a revised process window, or requires stopping until critical measurements are available. Do not confuse an educational illustration with a production release. Qualified personnel must perform a hazard assessment, conform to applicable standards and equipment procedures, and validate the physical result before any industrial application.

# Unit 2 · Lesson 2: Mold filling and fluidity

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **mold filling and fluidity** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A 3 kg aluminum charge enters a mold with a fixed metal delivery rate. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

These differences mean the correct question is not “Can this tool make the shape?” but “Can this qualified route repeatedly produce the required physical result, with documented uncertainty and acceptable cost?”

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Filling must occur before vulnerable thin sections freeze, but excess velocity promotes entrainment and erosion. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation.

## Worked numerical screening calculation

**Study:** Pouring duration. The illustrative expression is `3/0.25` and its result is approximately **12 seconds**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases. If this sign check contradicts the physical system, inspect the assumptions before increasing numerical precision. If a computation uses an empirical coefficient, state which process and material supplied it and which data would be needed to fit it. Here, the important qualification is: Rate is assumed constant and metal is taken as incompressible.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls.

The practical validation step for this particular topic is: Measure actual filling using safe instrumented trial coupons and compare with simulation.

The third decision concerns yield and variation. Separate startup rejects, stable-running defects, changeover losses and damage during handling. These categories imply different corrective action. If each rejected part has been recorded only as “bad,” useful information has already been discarded. Compare changes using matched material lots, measurement methods and operating conditions. Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** A single fill-time number says nothing about local freezing, turbulence or oxide-film folding. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure. Document both the result and the unresolved evidence gap.

Compare this lesson with **Casting routes and mold requirements** and anticipate **Solidification time and section modulus**. Manufacturing defects propagate between processes.

# Unit 2 · Lesson 3: Solidification time and section modulus

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **solidification time and section modulus** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A riser must remain liquid longer than the fed casting section. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

These differences mean the correct question is not “Can this tool make the shape?” but “Can this qualified route repeatedly produce the required physical result, with documented uncertainty and acceptable cost?”

## Physical principles and process mechanism

The local volume-to-cooling-area ratio controls approximate freezing time for similarly cooled cast sections. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation.

**Study:** Casting solidification time. The illustrative expression is `4*(2**2)` and its result is approximately **16 minutes**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** The mold constant is not universal, and local chills, alloys and geometry alter conditions. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure.

# Unit 2 · Lesson 4: Shrinkage, feeding and porosity

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **shrinkage, feeding and porosity** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A solidifying boss is last to freeze and cannot communicate with the riser through the thin neck. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

These differences mean the correct question is not “Can this tool make the shape?” but “Can this qualified route repeatedly produce the required physical result, with documented uncertainty and acceptable cost?”

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Solidification shrinkage creates a feeding demand; isolated liquid pockets and inadequate risers promote internal voids. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation.

**Study:** Solidification shrinkage deficit. The illustrative expression is `300*0.04` and its result is approximately **12 cm³**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases.

Here, the important qualification is: The shrinkage fraction is illustrative and cannot locate porosity.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls. If the formula is nonlinear, a 10% input change need not produce a 10% output change. Report at least one alternative route or parameter setting, and explain what evidence would justify choosing it.

Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** Volumetric deficit does not predict pore size or location, and gas porosity has a distinct mechanism. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large.

# Unit 2 · Lesson 5: Casting inspection and root-cause studies

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **casting inspection and root-cause studies** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: An investment casting passes visual inspection but fails leak testing after machining. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

Internal integrity and dimensional conformity require complementary methods and traceable acceptance criteria. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation. These distinctions determine what a useful calculation can and cannot represent. A model is most valuable when each term refers to a real feature that could be measured independently.

For the running case, An investment casting passes visual inspection but fails leak testing after machining. Form a sketch or process-flow diagram containing the workpiece, tool interfaces, material input, outgoing product, and likely rejection mechanisms. Label the direction of transport and the time order of operations. This clarifies what belongs to the model boundary and what belongs to a downstream process. The crucial engineering focus is **Radiography, dye penetrant, metrology and corrective action**. If these variables are not controlled, two nominally identical workpieces can arrive at the next station with different properties, even if both match the outline drawing.

A good first approximation should be deliberately small. Record initial material state; select one dominant mechanism; identify a representative geometry or operating point; and list the effects left out. Do not silently replace a measured value by a catalog average, particularly when temperature, orientation, strain rate, contamination or humidity change the underlying behavior. Industrial material and machine data must come from a verified source for the actual equipment and stock condition. The examples in this draft are provided to teach reasoning, not to certify a manufactured product.

## Worked numerical screening calculation

**Study:** Observed rejected casting percentage. The illustrative expression is `100*8/160` and its result is approximately **5 percent**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases. If this sign check contradicts the physical system, inspect the assumptions before increasing numerical precision. If a computation uses an empirical coefficient, state which process and material supplied it and which data would be needed to fit it. Here, the important qualification is: Classifying the defects is necessary before correcting the process.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls. If the formula is nonlinear, a 10% input change need not produce a 10% output change. Report at least one alternative route or parameter setting, and explain what evidence would justify choosing it. A spreadsheet or Python notebook should carry units in the headings, not merely in a paragraph after the calculation.

## Implementation sequence and shop-floor decisions

Start with the product's critical-to-quality features. Translate the service requirement into an inspection method, a documented tolerance or an experimentally defensible acceptance criterion. Choose a material specification and incoming material check. Next define a feasible setup: datum selection, tooling, fixture or containment, operating window, and operator-safety controls. Record the nominal inputs together with the allowable adjustment ranges and who may authorize process changes. A process plan that lists only machine names is incomplete; it says little about the actual transformation of material.

The second decision is whether to measure in-process, post-process or both. An in-process signal can provide fast feedback but may be only an indirect proxy for the finished feature. A final dimensional gauge can establish geometry yet miss subsurface defects, unfavorable microstructure and residual stress. Select evidence that is related to the failure mechanism, and define how measurements will be associated with lot, equipment, operator and material batch. The practical validation step for this particular topic is: Document nonconformance location and verify a corrective gating change against repeated lots.

The third decision concerns yield and variation. Separate startup rejects, stable-running defects, changeover losses and damage during handling. These categories imply different corrective action. If each rejected part has been recorded only as “bad,” useful information has already been discarded. Compare changes using matched material lots, measurement methods and operating conditions. Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** A pass/fail rate without defect classification can reward cosmetic improvement while leak failures persist. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure. Document both the result and the unresolved evidence gap.

Compare this lesson with **Shrinkage, feeding and porosity** and anticipate **the unit capstone**. Manufacturing defects propagate between processes. An inaccurate incoming blank can distort a finishing result; a poor thermal history can make a later crack appear to originate in machining; a tooling error can be mistaken for a measurement problem. Thus, a good failure investigation follows the material history upstream and downstream instead of blaming the most visible final operation. Rework should be treated as a new manufacturing step with its own process record and acceptance criteria.

**Measurement challenge.** Write down the measuring instrument, calibration or reference check, sampling location, operator, environmental variables and repeatability requirement. A numerical result without a plausible uncertainty or measurement method is not sufficient evidence of capability. For destructive evaluation, identify how the tested coupon represents actual geometry and process history; a convenient coupon can be unrepresentative of the part's critical region.

## Guided exercises

1. Define the controlling assumptions in **casting inspection and root-cause studies** and decide which ones are measurable during the production run.
2. Rebuild the numerical case for **observed rejected casting percentage** with one input changed by 15%; report the direction and physical meaning of the change.
3. For the situation “An investment casting passes visual inspection but fails leak testing after machining.”, design a short acceptance test that could reveal the risk: A pass/fail rate without defect classification can reward cosmetic improvement while leak failures persist.

For each answer, submit (a) a labeled drawing or process-flow diagram, (b) an equation with dimensions, (c) a paragraph that links the numerical result to physical behavior, and (d) a limitation or required measurement. An answer that contains only an arithmetic result is incomplete because it does not establish that the model applies to the proposed manufacturing case.

## Reflection and design review

Consider the following question: Which measurement would falsify the simplest version of the model? Give a plausible counterexample in which the simple estimate passes but the manufactured component still fails its function. Then propose a low-cost pilot test whose result would distinguish that counterexample from a correctly manufactured part. A second engineer should be able to reproduce the assumed calculation and understand why an acceptance decision was or was not made.

Finally prepare a short decision record. State whether the available evidence supports proceeding to prototype, indicates the need for a revised process window, or requires stopping until critical measurements are available. Do not confuse an educational illustration with a production release. Qualified personnel must perform a hazard assessment, conform to applicable standards and equipment procedures, and validate the physical result before any industrial application.
