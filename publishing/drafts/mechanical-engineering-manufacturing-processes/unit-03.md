# Unit 3 · Lesson 1: Plastic flow and work hardening

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **plastic flow and work hardening** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: Two alloys have the same initial yield strength but different hardening exponents. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

The unit-wide objective is: Use approximate forming mechanics to evaluate geometry, plastic strain, force requirements, thermal work and forming defects. The feature or material characteristic being produced must be connected to an end-use requirement. For example, a process may create nominal geometry but fail on microstructure, internal soundness, roughness, residual stress or long-term fatigue. These differences mean the correct question is not “Can this tool make the shape?” but “Can this qualified route repeatedly produce the required physical result, with documented uncertainty and acceptable cost?”

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Metal forming needs a constitutive law, friction assumptions, strain history and temperature window rather than an elastic stress-only analysis. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation. These distinctions determine what a useful calculation can and cannot represent. A model is most valuable when each term refers to a real feature that could be measured independently.

For the running case, Two alloys have the same initial yield strength but different hardening exponents. Form a sketch or process-flow diagram containing the workpiece, tool interfaces, material input, outgoing product, and likely rejection mechanisms. Label the direction of transport and the time order of operations. This clarifies what belongs to the model boundary and what belongs to a downstream process. The crucial engineering focus is **Flow curves, temperature and true strain**. If these variables are not controlled, two nominally identical workpieces can arrive at the next station with different properties, even if both match the outline drawing.

A good first approximation should be deliberately small. Record initial material state; select one dominant mechanism; identify a representative geometry or operating point; and list the effects left out. Do not silently replace a measured value by a catalog average, particularly when temperature, orientation, strain rate, contamination or humidity change the underlying behavior. Industrial material and machine data must come from a verified source for the actual equipment and stock condition. The examples in this draft are provided to teach reasoning, not to certify a manufactured product.

## Worked numerical screening calculation

**Study:** Power-law flow stress. The illustrative expression is `420*(0.20**0.18)` and its result is approximately **314.39 MPa**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases. If this sign check contradicts the physical system, inspect the assumptions before increasing numerical precision. If a computation uses an empirical coefficient, state which process and material supplied it and which data would be needed to fit it. Here, the important qualification is: Use calibrated K and n at the relevant deformation temperature and strain rate.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls. If the formula is nonlinear, a 10% input change need not produce a 10% output change. Report at least one alternative route or parameter setting, and explain what evidence would justify choosing it. A spreadsheet or Python notebook should carry units in the headings, not merely in a paragraph after the calculation.

## Implementation sequence and shop-floor decisions

Start with the product's critical-to-quality features. Translate the service requirement into an inspection method, a documented tolerance or an experimentally defensible acceptance criterion. Choose a material specification and incoming material check. Next define a feasible setup: datum selection, tooling, fixture or containment, operating window, and operator-safety controls. Record the nominal inputs together with the allowable adjustment ranges and who may authorize process changes. A process plan that lists only machine names is incomplete; it says little about the actual transformation of material.

The second decision is whether to measure in-process, post-process or both. An in-process signal can provide fast feedback but may be only an indirect proxy for the finished feature. A final dimensional gauge can establish geometry yet miss subsurface defects, unfavorable microstructure and residual stress. Select evidence that is related to the failure mechanism, and define how measurements will be associated with lot, equipment, operator and material batch. The practical validation step for this particular topic is: Compare measured flow stress at several plastic strains against an assumed power law.

The third decision concerns yield and variation. Separate startup rejects, stable-running defects, changeover losses and damage during handling. These categories imply different corrective action. If each rejected part has been recorded only as “bad,” useful information has already been discarded. Compare changes using matched material lots, measurement methods and operating conditions. Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** The law is an approximation over an experimentally established strain and thermal range. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure. Document both the result and the unresolved evidence gap.

Compare this lesson with **the unit requirements** and anticipate **Forging load and die considerations**. Manufacturing defects propagate between processes. An inaccurate incoming blank can distort a finishing result; a poor thermal history can make a later crack appear to originate in machining; a tooling error can be mistaken for a measurement problem. Thus, a good failure investigation follows the material history upstream and downstream instead of blaming the most visible final operation. Rework should be treated as a new manufacturing step with its own process record and acceptance criteria.

**Measurement challenge.** Write down the measuring instrument, calibration or reference check, sampling location, operator, environmental variables and repeatability requirement. A numerical result without a plausible uncertainty or measurement method is not sufficient evidence of capability. For destructive evaluation, identify how the tested coupon represents actual geometry and process history; a convenient coupon can be unrepresentative of the part's critical region.

## Guided exercises

1. Define the controlling assumptions in **plastic flow and work hardening** and decide which ones are measurable during the production run.
2. Rebuild the numerical case for **power-law flow stress** with one input changed by 15%; report the direction and physical meaning of the change.
3. For the situation “Two alloys have the same initial yield strength but different hardening exponents.”, design a short acceptance test that could reveal the risk: The law is an approximation over an experimentally established strain and thermal range.

For each answer, submit (a) a labeled drawing or process-flow diagram, (b) an equation with dimensions, (c) a paragraph that links the numerical result to physical behavior, and (d) a limitation or required measurement. An answer that contains only an arithmetic result is incomplete because it does not establish that the model applies to the proposed manufacturing case.

## Reflection and design review

Consider the following question: How would a change in batch size alter process choice and uncertainty? Give a plausible counterexample in which the simple estimate passes but the manufactured component still fails its function. Then propose a low-cost pilot test whose result would distinguish that counterexample from a correctly manufactured part. A second engineer should be able to reproduce the assumed calculation and understand why an acceptance decision was or was not made.

Finally prepare a short decision record. State whether the available evidence supports proceeding to prototype, indicates the need for a revised process window, or requires stopping until critical measurements are available. Do not confuse an educational illustration with a production release. Qualified personnel must perform a hazard assessment, conform to applicable standards and equipment procedures, and validate the physical result before any industrial application.

# Unit 3 · Lesson 2: Forging load and die considerations

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **forging load and die considerations** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A circular billet is upset to a shorter cylinder. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

These differences mean the correct question is not “Can this tool make the shape?” but “Can this qualified route repeatedly produce the required physical result, with documented uncertainty and acceptable cost?”

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Forging force increases with flow stress, contact area and restraint from die friction; parting and flash influence flow. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation.

Label the direction of transport and the time order of operations. This clarifies what belongs to the model boundary and what belongs to a downstream process. The crucial engineering focus is **Press force, friction, die fill and strain localization**. If these variables are not controlled, two nominally identical workpieces can arrive at the next station with different properties, even if both match the outline drawing.

A good first approximation should be deliberately small. Record initial material state; select one dominant mechanism; identify a representative geometry or operating point; and list the effects left out.

## Worked numerical screening calculation

**Study:** Friction-free forging force screen. The illustrative expression is `180*1500/1000` and its result is approximately **270 kN**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases. If this sign check contradicts the physical system, inspect the assumptions before increasing numerical precision. If a computation uses an empirical coefficient, state which process and material supplied it and which data would be needed to fit it. Here, the important qualification is: Load excludes side friction, redundant work and changes in area during upset.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls. If the formula is nonlinear, a 10% input change need not produce a 10% output change. Report at least one alternative route or parameter setting, and explain what evidence would justify choosing it.

The practical validation step for this particular topic is: Sketch load versus stroke and identify the peak forging stage and likely laps.

The third decision concerns yield and variation. Separate startup rejects, stable-running defects, changeover losses and damage during handling. These categories imply different corrective action. If each rejected part has been recorded only as “bad,” useful information has already been discarded. Compare changes using matched material lots, measurement methods and operating conditions. Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** Using a lower-bound force as a press capacity estimate is unsafe without friction, tooling and stroke effects. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure. Document both the result and the unresolved evidence gap.

Compare this lesson with **Plastic flow and work hardening** and anticipate **Rolling reduction and neutral point**. Manufacturing defects propagate between processes. An inaccurate incoming blank can distort a finishing result; a poor thermal history can make a later crack appear to originate in machining; a tooling error can be mistaken for a measurement problem.

# Unit 3 · Lesson 3: Rolling reduction and neutral point

**OpenSTEM Mechanical Engineering — Manufacturing Processes**  
*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **rolling reduction and neutral point** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A strip enters at 5.0 mm and leaves at 4.0 mm. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Rolling compresses thickness under roll pressure, with changes in strip speed, contact pressure and friction. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation.

**Study:** Rolling percentage reduction. The illustrative expression is `100*(5-4)/5` and its result is approximately **20 percent**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **extrusion and drawing** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: An aluminum bar is extruded from 600 mm² to 150 mm². Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice. You should also be able to distinguish a process setting from a measured result, explain how the required service function is connected to manufacturing decisions, and state a condition under which the simplified model is unsuitable.

Cross-section reduction changes flow patterns, force, temperature rise and defect susceptibility. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation.

# Unit 3 · Lesson 5: Sheet forming and springback

*Unreviewed educational draft; values are synthetic examples, not industrial specifications.*

## Learning outcomes and problem definition

This lesson investigates **sheet forming and springback** as an engineering decision rather than an isolated equation. The central issue is concrete: A folded stainless-steel enclosure springs open after the forming die releases it. Your goal is to identify the primary physical mechanism; define the input quantities, their dimensions and relevant ranges; estimate one consequence; and specify evidence that could overturn the initial choice.

## Physical principles and process mechanism

Bending and deep drawing require control of plastic instability, residual stress, blank holding and material anisotropy. The process result arises from a chain of events, not a single input setting. Trace how energy, load, momentum or material is transferred from equipment through the work material, tooling and environment. Then identify where irreversible effects appear: plastic flow, solidification, phase change, chip formation, bonding, material removal, chemical reaction or defect formation. These distinctions determine what a useful calculation can and cannot represent. A model is most valuable when each term refers to a real feature that could be measured independently.

For the running case, A folded stainless-steel enclosure springs open after the forming die releases it. Form a sketch or process-flow diagram containing the workpiece, tool interfaces, material input, outgoing product, and likely rejection mechanisms. Label the direction of transport and the time order of operations. This clarifies what belongs to the model boundary and what belongs to a downstream process. The crucial engineering focus is **Springback, bend radius, tearing and wrinkling**. If these variables are not controlled, two nominally identical workpieces can arrive at the next station with different properties, even if both match the outline drawing.

A good first approximation should be deliberately small. Record initial material state; select one dominant mechanism; identify a representative geometry or operating point; and list the effects left out. Do not silently replace a measured value by a catalog average, particularly when temperature, orientation, strain rate, contamination or humidity change the underlying behavior. Industrial material and machine data must come from a verified source for the actual equipment and stock condition. The examples in this draft are provided to teach reasoning, not to certify a manufactured product.

## Worked numerical screening calculation

**Study:** Tooling springback deviation. The illustrative expression is `92-90` and its result is approximately **2 degrees**. Record the original input values alongside the equation rather than reporting the final number alone. The intent is to see how a limited calculation informs a process choice; it does not mean the route has been validated.

Write the equation dimensionally and confirm the conversion used to reach the result. Ask whether the response should rise or fall when the most influential input increases. If this sign check contradicts the physical system, inspect the assumptions before increasing numerical precision. If a computation uses an empirical coefficient, state which process and material supplied it and which data would be needed to fit it. Here, the important qualification is: Angle compensation must use repeat data and stiffness for the actual material.

**Sensitivity experiment.** Increase one selected process input by 10% while holding the others fixed, and predict whether the response rises or falls. If the formula is nonlinear, a 10% input change need not produce a 10% output change. Report at least one alternative route or parameter setting, and explain what evidence would justify choosing it. A spreadsheet or Python notebook should carry units in the headings, not merely in a paragraph after the calculation.

## Implementation sequence and shop-floor decisions

Start with the product's critical-to-quality features. Translate the service requirement into an inspection method, a documented tolerance or an experimentally defensible acceptance criterion. Choose a material specification and incoming material check. Next define a feasible setup: datum selection, tooling, fixture or containment, operating window, and operator-safety controls. Record the nominal inputs together with the allowable adjustment ranges and who may authorize process changes. A process plan that lists only machine names is incomplete; it says little about the actual transformation of material.

The second decision is whether to measure in-process, post-process or both. An in-process signal can provide fast feedback but may be only an indirect proxy for the finished feature. A final dimensional gauge can establish geometry yet miss subsurface defects, unfavorable microstructure and residual stress. Select evidence that is related to the failure mechanism, and define how measurements will be associated with lot, equipment, operator and material batch. The practical validation step for this particular topic is: Run a designed series of bends and report unloaded angle distributions.

The third decision concerns yield and variation. Separate startup rejects, stable-running defects, changeover losses and damage during handling. These categories imply different corrective action. If each rejected part has been recorded only as “bad,” useful information has already been discarded. Compare changes using matched material lots, measurement methods and operating conditions. Do not declare improvement after a favorable small sample without considering sampling uncertainty and the possibility of correlated defects.

## Failure mechanisms, diagnostic clues and boundaries

**Primary failure or modeling trap:** A single angle correction cannot represent thickness, rolling direction and batch-to-batch effects. This warning is material to decisions, not a general disclaimer. Identify which part of the predicted result would remain valid and which part would change if the omitted effect were large. When the actual mechanism lies beyond a one-dimensional formula, use a more appropriate experiment, calibrated simulation, microstructural examination or process qualification procedure. Document both the result and the unresolved evidence gap.

Compare this lesson with **Extrusion and drawing** and anticipate **the unit capstone**. Manufacturing defects propagate between processes. An inaccurate incoming blank can distort a finishing result; a poor thermal history can make a later crack appear to originate in machining; a tooling error can be mistaken for a measurement problem. Thus, a good failure investigation follows the material history upstream and downstream instead of blaming the most visible final operation. Rework should be treated as a new manufacturing step with its own process record and acceptance criteria.

**Measurement challenge.** Write down the measuring instrument, calibration or reference check, sampling location, operator, environmental variables and repeatability requirement. A numerical result without a plausible uncertainty or measurement method is not sufficient evidence of capability. For destructive evaluation, identify how the tested coupon represents actual geometry and process history; a convenient coupon can be unrepresentative of the part's critical region.

## Guided exercises

1. Define the controlling assumptions in **sheet forming and springback** and decide which ones are measurable during the production run.
2. Rebuild the numerical case for **tooling springback deviation** with one input changed by 15%; report the direction and physical meaning of the change.
3. For the situation “A folded stainless-steel enclosure springs open after the forming die releases it.”, design a short acceptance test that could reveal the risk: A single angle correction cannot represent thickness, rolling direction and batch-to-batch effects.

For each answer, submit (a) a labeled drawing or process-flow diagram, (b) an equation with dimensions, (c) a paragraph that links the numerical result to physical behavior, and (d) a limitation or required measurement. An answer that contains only an arithmetic result is incomplete because it does not establish that the model applies to the proposed manufacturing case.

## Reflection and design review

Consider the following question: How would a change in batch size alter process choice and uncertainty? Give a plausible counterexample in which the simple estimate passes but the manufactured component still fails its function. Then propose a low-cost pilot test whose result would distinguish that counterexample from a correctly manufactured part. A second engineer should be able to reproduce the assumed calculation and understand why an acceptance decision was or was not made.

Finally prepare a short decision record. State whether the available evidence supports proceeding to prototype, indicates the need for a revised process window, or requires stopping until critical measurements are available. Do not confuse an educational illustration with a production release. Qualified personnel must perform a hazard assessment, conform to applicable standards and equipment procedures, and validate the physical result before any industrial application.
