**Course Code**: ERM 402 · **Level**: Advanced Undergraduate Engineering

## Unit Overview & Physical Foundations

This comprehensive university textbook unit covers the theoretical framework, physical modeling, mathematical governing equations, and engineering applications of **Failure-Time Statistics and Data Quality**.

# Unit 02 · Lesson 01 — Survival functions and hazard interpretation

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

The survival function R(t)=P(T>t) reports probability of lifetime exceeding time t. The density f(t) describes how first-failure probability is distributed; hazard h(t)=f(t)/R(t) is a conditional instantaneous failure propensity given survival. Hazard is not identical to cumulative probability.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: A time-to-failure distribution maps exposure into probability. Survival, density, hazard and cumulative hazard play different roles; the Weibull shape parameter can reveal plausible aging patterns but does not by itself prove a physical mechanism. Right-censored units have survived to last observation and must not be coded as failures. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Keep the operational objective in view

A metric is useful when it changes a decision that helps deliver service. Additional data collection should therefore answer a concrete question: whether to inspect, redesign, change stocking policy, add monitoring or accept an explicitly bounded residual risk.

A professional worksheet for **survival functions and hazard interpretation** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `R(t)=1-F(t); h(t)=f(t)/R(t); H(t)=-ln R(t).`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** If 90 of 100 initially identical components survive to 1,000 hours in a complete uncensored study, empirical survival is 0.90 at that time; a hazard value cannot be obtained from this single proportion without additional temporal assumptions.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Define the denominator

Write down the reference population and the interval across which the observation has meaning. An event per machine-day differs from an event per operating hour if production schedules differ. A simulation that silently uses an assumed denominator produces a neat but potentially false comparison.

## 3. Where the model can fail

A rising hazard indicates age-related selection within the modeled population, not proof that one physical wear mechanism has been identified.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Separate requirement from measurement

An engineer should be able to state the acceptance requirement before seeing the measurement. Otherwise thresholds tend to move after results are known. Preserve the original requirement, report any exception and obtain authorized approval for changes.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Sketch an increasing and decreasing hazard with corresponding operational interpretations.

Connect this task to the unit study: A set of ten motors installed on different days should be aligned by operating hours, not calendar date. If three units remain operating at the study cutoff, those three observations are right-censored, even if they have the longest observed times. Discarding them exaggerates risk. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a data dictionary with start events, failure events, censoring rules, exposure units, known data gaps and a sensitivity analysis. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise. Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision. For plant-level application, specify which person may authorize a shutdown, restart or alteration of protection logic; a textbook exercise never supplies that authorization.

## 5. Exercises and instructor checkpoints

1. **Definitions.** Define the physical or functional event involved in **survival functions and hazard interpretation**. Give its observable boundary and one alternative definition that would change the counted population.
2. **Quantification.** Use the relation `R(t)=1-F(t); h(t)=f(t)/R(t); H(t)=-ln R(t).` with a consistent assumed dataset of your own. Show all units and at least one limiting-case check.
3. **Sensitivity.** Change the most uncertain nonzero input by ±20% where physically meaningful. Compare the output and decide whether the maintenance choice is robust.
4. **Counterexample.** Explain precisely why the following limitation matters: A rising hazard indicates age-related selection within the modeled population, not proof that one physical wear mechanism has been identified.
5. **Application.** Sketch an increasing and decreasing hazard with corresponding operational interpretations. Supply an evidence table with at least three observations and mark each entry as measured, supplied by a source, or synthetic.

**Self-check guidance.** A correct response identifies the function, model, assumptions, arithmetic, consequence and plausible falsification. The numeric exercise should be reproducible from the student's displayed inputs. The sensitivity response should not silently vary an independent parameter if two inputs are physically coupled. The field task should end with an evidence request or a testable action rather than a generic recommendation to “do maintenance.”

## 6. Connections to the wider curriculum

This topic interacts with earlier units through lifetime probability, state restoration, operating mechanisms and cost. When proposing a spare or a maintenance interval, ask how it changes both the frequency of failures and the length of lost service. When proposing a sensor, ask how often it produces a useful warning and how the organization responds. An effective recommendation uses the smallest set of credible assumptions needed for the stated decision and explains the circumstances under which its simplified formula would stop being useful.

**Source-reading exercise.** Compare the language of your model with the NIST reliability handbook or the NASA reliability-centered maintenance material listed in the references. Do not reproduce external texts; use the primary source to check the meaning of the statistical term or maintenance method, then describe the limitation in your own words.

# Unit 02 · Lesson 02 — Exponential failure-time model

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

The exponential model assumes a constant hazard, making it useful for a baseline calculation when there is no clear age effect. Its mathematical memorylessness means an item that survives an hour has the same conditional future distribution as a new item under this model. Many wear-out mechanisms do not behave this way.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: A time-to-failure distribution maps exposure into probability. Survival, density, hazard and cumulative hazard play different roles; the Weibull shape parameter can reveal plausible aging patterns but does not by itself prove a physical mechanism. Right-censored units have survived to last observation and must not be coded as failures. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Make uncertainty actionable

The practical response to missing information is usually a low-cost measurement, a conservative bound or a controlled trial. Sensitivity analysis exposes which uncertain assumption is capable of reversing a recommendation.

A professional worksheet for **exponential failure-time model** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `R(t)=exp(-λt), MTTF=1/λ, λ>0.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** For λ=2e-4 per hour and mission length 1,000 hours, R=exp(-0.2)=0.8187; the probability of first failure during the mission is 0.1813.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Keep the physical mechanism visible

An apparent trend in a chart is evidence about recorded variables, not automatically the explanation of a component failure. Ask which loads, contamination pathways, temperatures, controls, maintenance practices or environmental stresses could produce the observed pattern.

## 3. Where the model can fail

Replacing an item solely due to calendar age does not improve its modeled exponential survival probability; repairs, infant mortality and imperfect replacement may violate the model.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Distinguish data from decisions

A probability is an input to a decision rather than a decision by itself. Two alternatives with equal failure probability can lead to different responses when consequences, restoration time and regulatory obligations are different.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Identify an application for which constant hazard is plausible and one for which fatigue growth suggests otherwise.

Connect this task to the unit study: Estimate reliability for a hypothetical compressor seal at 2,000 running hours using exponential and Weibull assumptions. Make a plot of survival and explain which input is an engineering assumption and which is supported by measured evidence. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a data dictionary with start events, failure events, censoring rules, exposure units, known data gaps and a sensitivity analysis. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise. Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision.

# Unit 02 · Lesson 03 — Weibull scale and shape

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

A two-parameter Weibull family can represent decreasing, constant or increasing hazard depending on shape β. The scale η is the time at which survival is exp(-1), not a default “rated life.” Parameter fitting requires failure and censoring data and diagnostic plots, not intuition alone.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: A time-to-failure distribution maps exposure into probability. Survival, density, hazard and cumulative hazard play different roles; the Weibull shape parameter can reveal plausible aging patterns but does not by itself prove a physical mechanism. Right-censored units have survived to last observation and must not be coded as failures. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Plan a falsification test

A good explanation can be disproved. State an observation that would contradict the proposed failure mechanism, and arrange measurements so another engineer could reach an independent conclusion rather than merely agreeing with the initial diagnosis.

A professional worksheet for **weibull scale and shape** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `R(t)=exp[-(t/η)^β], h(t)=(β/η)(t/η)^(β-1).`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** For β=2 and η=4,000 hours, survival at 2,000 hours is exp(-0.25)=0.7788. At η it is exp(-1)=0.3679 regardless of β.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Separate requirement from measurement

An engineer should be able to state the acceptance requirement before seeing the measurement. Otherwise thresholds tend to move after results are known. Preserve the original requirement, report any exception and obtain authorized approval for changes.

## 3. Where the model can fail

A mixed population with poor installation quality and a normal population can mimic a broad lifetime pattern; segment by operating condition before declaring a universal β.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Audit model assumptions

Every model has a region in which its assumptions make sense. Before using an equation in a recommendation, check units, boundary, independence assumptions, the way failures are counted, and whether repair changes the modeled population.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Calculate R at t=η/2 for β=0.8, 1 and 2; interpret the design implications.

Connect this task to the unit study: Estimate reliability for a hypothetical compressor seal at 2,000 running hours using exponential and Weibull assumptions. Make a plot of survival and explain which input is an engineering assumption and which is supported by measured evidence. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a data dictionary with start events, failure events, censoring rules, exposure units, known data gaps and a sensitivity analysis. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis.

# Unit 02 · Lesson 04 — Lognormal lifetimes and competing risks

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

Lognormal models are useful when lifetime varies multiplicatively, such as products of uncertain loads and material strengths. Competing mechanisms can cause observed failure at the earliest mechanism-specific time; a single fitted distribution may hide corrosion versus fatigue subgroups.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: A time-to-failure distribution maps exposure into probability. Survival, density, hazard and cumulative hazard play different roles; the Weibull shape parameter can reveal plausible aging patterns but does not by itself prove a physical mechanism. Right-censored units have survived to last observation and must not be coded as failures. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Define the denominator

Write down the reference population and the interval across which the observation has meaning. An event per machine-day differs from an event per operating hour if production schedules differ. A simulation that silently uses an assumed denominator produces a neat but potentially false comparison.

A professional worksheet for **lognormal lifetimes and competing risks** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `For independent competing mechanisms with survivals R1(t),R2(t), overall R(t)=R1(t)R2(t).`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** If corrosion-related survival over a mission is 0.96 and bearing-related survival is 0.90, independence gives 0.864, with an important assumption that the mechanisms do not share stress drivers.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Distinguish data from decisions

A probability is an input to a decision rather than a decision by itself. Two alternatives with equal failure probability can lead to different responses when consequences, restoration time and regulatory obligations are different.

## 3. Where the model can fail

A component replaced after corrosion before fatigue occurs produces competing-risk censoring; naïve failure tallies do not identify the underlying latent fatigue lifetime distribution.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Keep the operational objective in view

A metric is useful when it changes a decision that helps deliver service. Additional data collection should therefore answer a concrete question: whether to inspect, redesign, change stocking policy, add monitoring or accept an explicitly bounded residual risk.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Propose how to tag root mechanisms and measure temperature, water contamination and load spectra.

Connect this task to the unit study: A set of ten motors installed on different days should be aligned by operating hours, not calendar date. If three units remain operating at the study cutoff, those three observations are right-censored, even if they have the longest observed times. Discarding them exaggerates risk. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a data dictionary with start events, failure events, censoring rules, exposure units, known data gaps and a sensitivity analysis. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise. Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision. For plant-level application, specify which person may authorize a shutdown, restart or alteration of protection logic; a textbook exercise never supplies that authorization.

The numeric exercise should be reproducible from the student's displayed inputs. The sensitivity response should not silently vary an independent parameter if two inputs are physically coupled. The field task should end with an evidence request or a testable action rather than a generic recommendation to “do maintenance.”

## 6. Connections to the wider curriculum

This topic interacts with earlier units through lifetime probability, state restoration, operating mechanisms and cost. When proposing a spare or a maintenance interval, ask how it changes both the frequency of failures and the length of lost service. When proposing a sensor, ask how often it produces a useful warning and how the organization responds. An effective recommendation uses the smallest set of credible assumptions needed for the stated decision and explains the circumstances under which its simplified formula would stop being useful.

**Source-reading exercise.** Compare the language of your model with the NIST reliability handbook or the NASA reliability-centered maintenance material listed in the references. Do not reproduce external texts; use the primary source to check the meaning of the statistical term or maintenance method, then describe the limitation in your own words.

# Unit 02 · Lesson 05 — Censoring, estimation and uncertainty

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

A right-censored observation contributes evidence of survival up to a known time, not evidence of failure at that time. Interval censoring occurs when the exact event is known only between inspections. Statistical inference must reflect how testing stopped, who was selected and which failed units were excluded.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: A time-to-failure distribution maps exposure into probability. Survival, density, hazard and cumulative hazard play different roles; the Weibull shape parameter can reveal plausible aging patterns but does not by itself prove a physical mechanism. Right-censored units have survived to last observation and must not be coded as failures. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Keep the physical mechanism visible

An apparent trend in a chart is evidence about recorded variables, not automatically the explanation of a component failure. Ask which loads, contamination pathways, temperatures, controls, maintenance practices or environmental stresses could produce the observed pattern.

A professional worksheet for **censoring, estimation and uncertainty** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `Kaplan–Meier estimator: S(t)=Π_(event times <=t)(1-d_i/n_i), with n_i at risk just before each time.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** Three units fail at 100, 200 and 400 hours; one more is censored at 300. The risk set at the 400-hour event excludes the censored unit. Treating the censor at 300 as a failure forces survival too low.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Audit model assumptions

Every model has a region in which its assumptions make sense. Before using an equation in a recommendation, check units, boundary, independence assumptions, the way failures are counted, and whether repair changes the modeled population.

## 3. Where the model can fail

A confidence interval is not the probability that the unknown fixed parameter lies within one particular computed interval under frequentist interpretation.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Make uncertainty actionable

The practical response to missing information is usually a low-cost measurement, a conservative bound or a controlled trial. Sensitivity analysis exposes which uncertain assumption is capable of reversing a recommendation.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Create a study plan that registers entry time, event type, censoring reason, and precision of recorded time.

Connect this task to the unit study: Estimate reliability for a hypothetical compressor seal at 2,000 running hours using exponential and Weibull assumptions. Make a plot of survival and explain which input is an engineering assumption and which is supported by measured evidence. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a data dictionary with start events, failure events, censoring rules, exposure units, known data gaps and a sensitivity analysis. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise. Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision. For plant-level application, specify which person may authorize a shutdown, restart or alteration of protection logic; a textbook exercise never supplies that authorization.

## 5. Exercises and instructor checkpoints

1. **Definitions.** Define the physical or functional event involved in **censoring, estimation and uncertainty**. Give its observable boundary and one alternative definition that would change the counted population.
2. **Quantification.** Use the relation `Kaplan–Meier estimator: S(t)=Π_(event times <=t)(1-d_i/n_i), with n_i at risk just before each time.` with a consistent assumed dataset of your own. Show all units and at least one limiting-case check.
3. **Sensitivity.** Change the most uncertain nonzero input by ±20% where physically meaningful. Compare the output and decide whether the maintenance choice is robust.
4. **Counterexample.** Explain precisely why the following limitation matters: A confidence interval is not the probability that the unknown fixed parameter lies within one particular computed interval under frequentist interpretation.
5. **Application.** Create a study plan that registers entry time, event type, censoring reason, and precision of recorded time. Supply an evidence table with at least three observations and mark each entry as measured, supplied by a source, or synthetic.

**Self-check guidance.** A correct response identifies the function, model, assumptions, arithmetic, consequence and plausible falsification. The numeric exercise should be reproducible from the student's displayed inputs. The sensitivity response should not silently vary an independent parameter if two inputs are physically coupled. The field task should end with an evidence request or a testable action rather than a generic recommendation to “do maintenance.”
