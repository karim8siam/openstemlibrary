# Unit 07: Reliability Test Programs, Design for Maintainability and Safety

**Course Code**: ERM 407 · **Level**: Advanced Undergraduate Engineering

## Unit Overview & Physical Foundations

This comprehensive university textbook unit covers the theoretical framework, physical modeling, mathematical governing equations, and engineering applications of **Reliability Test Programs, Design for Maintainability and Safety**.

# Unit 07 · Lesson 01 — Reliability demonstration and test planning

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

A demonstration test supports a specific survival claim over specific stress and time, with a stated statistical confidence convention. Testing no failures is evidence, but uncertainty can remain large. Choose a test plan from consequences, expected reliability, feasible exposure and production variability.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: Reliability targets need evidence from design review, testing, field data and physics-of-failure analysis. Zero failures in a short demonstration do not prove perfection. Maintainability depends on physical access, isolation, identification, lifting provisions, diagnostic coverage and human procedures. Safety barriers need independent scrutiny. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Make uncertainty actionable

The practical response to missing information is usually a low-cost measurement, a conservative bound or a controlled trial. Sensitivity analysis exposes which uncertain assumption is capable of reversing a recommendation.

A professional worksheet for **reliability demonstration and test planning** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `With zero failures over T total independent item-hours under a constant hazard, one-sided upper 95% λ≈-ln(0.05)/T.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** For T=3,000 item-hours with no observed failure, the approximate upper failure intensity is 0.000999/hour at 95% one-sided confidence under model assumptions.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Keep the physical mechanism visible

An apparent trend in a chart is evidence about recorded variables, not automatically the explanation of a component failure. Ask which loads, contamination pathways, temperatures, controls, maintenance practices or environmental stresses could produce the observed pattern.

## 3. Where the model can fail

A single long run does not verify behavior under frequent starts or cold conditions. A qualification protocol must represent the mechanisms that matter.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Distinguish data from decisions

A probability is an input to a decision rather than a decision by itself. Two alternatives with equal failure probability can lead to different responses when consequences, restoration time and regulatory obligations are different.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Design a transparent reliability demonstration for a valve actuator and calculate the exposure needed for a proposed λ target.

Connect this task to the unit study: A prototype actuator survives 200 laboratory cycles. That observation is not evidence that every production unit will survive 100,000 field cycles, especially if field dust, temperature variation and operator load differ. A credible demonstration links exposure and conditions to the claim. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a requirement-to-evidence matrix, test protocol, repair task analysis, change-control log and unresolved safety questions. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise. Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision. For plant-level application, specify which person may authorize a shutdown, restart or alteration of protection logic; a textbook exercise never supplies that authorization.

## 5. Exercises and instructor checkpoints

1. **Definitions.** Define the physical or functional event involved in **reliability demonstration and test planning**. Give its observable boundary and one alternative definition that would change the counted population.
2. **Quantification.** Use the relation `With zero failures over T total independent item-hours under a constant hazard, one-sided upper 95% λ≈-ln(0.05)/T.` with a consistent assumed dataset of your own. Show all units and at least one limiting-case check.
3. **Sensitivity.** Change the most uncertain nonzero input by ±20% where physically meaningful. Compare the output and decide whether the maintenance choice is robust.
4. **Counterexample.** Explain precisely why the following limitation matters: A single long run does not verify behavior under frequent starts or cold conditions. A qualification protocol must represent the mechanisms that matter.
5. **Application.** Design a transparent reliability demonstration for a valve actuator and calculate the exposure needed for a proposed λ target. Supply an evidence table with at least three observations and mark each entry as measured, supplied by a source, or synthetic.

**Self-check guidance.** A correct response identifies the function, model, assumptions, arithmetic, consequence and plausible falsification. The numeric exercise should be reproducible from the student's displayed inputs. The sensitivity response should not silently vary an independent parameter if two inputs are physically coupled. The field task should end with an evidence request or a testable action rather than a generic recommendation to “do maintenance.”

## 6. Connections to the wider curriculum

This topic interacts with earlier units through lifetime probability, state restoration, operating mechanisms and cost. When proposing a spare or a maintenance interval, ask how it changes both the frequency of failures and the length of lost service. When proposing a sensor, ask how often it produces a useful warning and how the organization responds. An effective recommendation uses the smallest set of credible assumptions needed for the stated decision and explains the circumstances under which its simplified formula would stop being useful.

**Source-reading exercise.** Compare the language of your model with the NIST reliability handbook or the NASA reliability-centered maintenance material listed in the references. Do not reproduce external texts; use the primary source to check the meaning of the statistical term or maintenance method, then describe the limitation in your own words.

# Unit 07 · Lesson 02 — Accelerated stress tests and physics-of-failure

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

Accelerated testing deliberately increases a stress to observe failures sooner. Extrapolation to nominal service requires a physically credible relationship between stress and degradation, and the stress must not trigger an entirely new mechanism. Temperature, vibration, humidity and cycling can interact.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: Reliability targets need evidence from design review, testing, field data and physics-of-failure analysis. Zero failures in a short demonstration do not prove perfection. Maintainability depends on physical access, isolation, identification, lifting provisions, diagnostic coverage and human procedures. Safety barriers need independent scrutiny. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Plan a falsification test

A good explanation can be disproved. State an observation that would contradict the proposed failure mechanism, and arrange measurements so another engineer could reach an independent conclusion rather than merely agreeing with the initial diagnosis.

A professional worksheet for **accelerated stress tests and physics-of-failure** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `An illustrative Arrhenius-type acceleration factor for temperature-sensitive processes: AF=exp[(Ea/k)(1/T_use-1/T_test)], with T in kelvin.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** A seal tested at high temperature may age chemically faster, but an extreme temperature can cause a failure mode absent in field service. Inspect samples for mechanism consistency.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Separate requirement from measurement

An engineer should be able to state the acceptance requirement before seeing the measurement. Otherwise thresholds tend to move after results are known. Preserve the original requirement, report any exception and obtain authorized approval for changes.

## 3. Where the model can fail

Do not treat acceleration factors as universal constants or use them outside material-specific calibrated regimes.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Audit model assumptions

Every model has a region in which its assumptions make sense. Before using an equation in a recommendation, check units, boundary, independence assumptions, the way failures are counted, and whether repair changes the modeled population.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Draft an accelerated test matrix varying temperature and cycling separately, with failure-analysis checkpoints.

Connect this task to the unit study: Plan an accelerated bearing test and an acceptance maintenance rehearsal for a new industrial manipulator, including safe energy isolation and measurement uncertainty. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a requirement-to-evidence matrix, test protocol, repair task analysis, change-control log and unresolved safety questions. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise.

# Unit 07 · Lesson 03 — Maintainability by design and human access

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

Maintainability is partly designed into the machine: access to grease points, lifting eyes, isolation valves, standardized fasteners, fault codes, test ports and modular replacement reduce repair uncertainty. Serviceability reviews should include actual technicians and maintenance tools rather than only design drawings.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: Reliability targets need evidence from design review, testing, field data and physics-of-failure analysis. Zero failures in a short demonstration do not prove perfection. Maintainability depends on physical access, isolation, identification, lifting provisions, diagnostic coverage and human procedures. Safety barriers need independent scrutiny. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Define the denominator

Write down the reference population and the interval across which the observation has meaning. An event per machine-day differs from an event per operating hour if production schedules differ. A simulation that silently uses an assumed denominator produces a neat but potentially false comparison.

A professional worksheet for **maintainability by design and human access** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `Total service restoration time = diagnosis + isolation + access + replacement + test + logistics and other holds, with overlap rules stated.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** A 6-kilogram motor may be cheap to change on a bench but difficult to replace when mounted 4 metres above a narrow walkway. Safe access could dominate mean restoration time.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Distinguish data from decisions

A probability is an input to a decision rather than a decision by itself. Two alternatives with equal failure probability can lead to different responses when consequences, restoration time and regulatory obligations are different.

## 3. Where the model can fail

Design for maintainability must not compromise guards, interlocks, pressure containment or energy isolation, even if opening the panel becomes slower.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Keep the operational objective in view

A metric is useful when it changes a decision that helps deliver service. Additional data collection should therefore answer a concrete question: whether to inspect, redesign, change stocking policy, add monitoring or accept an explicitly bounded residual risk.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Conduct a timed mock repair with safe isolation, calibrated tools, labeled connectors and a post-repair verification checklist.

Connect this task to the unit study: Plan an accelerated bearing test and an acceptance maintenance rehearsal for a new industrial manipulator, including safe energy isolation and measurement uncertainty. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a requirement-to-evidence matrix, test protocol, repair task analysis, change-control log and unresolved safety questions. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass.

# Unit 07 · Lesson 04 — Safety barriers and high-consequence systems

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

Hazard controls differ from ordinary reliability improvements. Independent protection layers, safe-state design, inspection, proof testing and management of change may be necessary when loss of function can injure people. Probabilistic calculations support decisions but cannot replace applicable regulations or competent hazard reviews.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: Reliability targets need evidence from design review, testing, field data and physics-of-failure analysis. Zero failures in a short demonstration do not prove perfection. Maintainability depends on physical access, isolation, identification, lifting provisions, diagnostic coverage and human procedures. Safety barriers need independent scrutiny. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Keep the physical mechanism visible

An apparent trend in a chart is evidence about recorded variables, not automatically the explanation of a component failure. Ask which loads, contamination pathways, temperatures, controls, maintenance practices or environmental stresses could produce the observed pattern.

A professional worksheet for **safety barriers and high-consequence systems** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `Residual risk should be assessed across initiating events, preventive safeguards, detection, mitigation and consequence severity; no single scalar is sufficient.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** A pressure vessel relief device may have a low probability of demand yet severe consequences if it fails to open. Proof testing and safe discharge paths matter even when economic expected loss is small.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Audit model assumptions

Every model has a region in which its assumptions make sense. Before using an equation in a recommendation, check units, boundary, independence assumptions, the way failures are counted, and whether repair changes the modeled population.

## 3. Where the model can fail

Do not use classroom reliability calculators to select safety integrity levels or certify protection systems.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Make uncertainty actionable

The practical response to missing information is usually a low-cost measurement, a conservative bound or a controlled trial. Sensitivity analysis exposes which uncertain assumption is capable of reversing a recommendation.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Map safeguards for a steam system and identify which tasks require authorized technical signoff.

Connect this task to the unit study: A prototype actuator survives 200 laboratory cycles. That observation is not evidence that every production unit will survive 100,000 field cycles, especially if field dust, temperature variation and operator load differ. A credible demonstration links exposure and conditions to the claim. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a requirement-to-evidence matrix, test protocol, repair task analysis, change-control log and unresolved safety questions.

Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision. For plant-level application, specify which person may authorize a shutdown, restart or alteration of protection logic; a textbook exercise never supplies that authorization.

# Unit 07 · Lesson 05 — Life-cycle cost and staged improvement

**Learning goal.** Explain the core engineering statement, calculate a clearly bounded example, challenge at least one assumption and propose a measurable action. This material is an educational draft, not an authority for equipment acceptance.

## 1. Concept and technical meaning

Life-cycle analysis includes investment, operations, maintenance, lost production, energy, risk exposure and end-of-life. Use discounted cash flows consistently and separate financial options from mandatory safety measures. Good recommendations present a reversible pilot and a threshold for expanding implementation.

The useful starting question is **“What physical or service event am I modeling?”** Place the studied item within the unit's central objective: Reliability targets need evidence from design review, testing, field data and physics-of-failure analysis. Zero failures in a short demonstration do not prove perfection. Maintainability depends on physical access, isolation, identification, lifting provisions, diagnostic coverage and human procedures. Safety barriers need independent scrutiny. A numerical value only becomes an engineering claim when the mission duration, operating conditions, item state and decision boundary are specified. If the equipment is repaired between events, decide whether the model starts a new life or continues to represent accumulated degradation. When data are drawn from multiple installations, check whether load, age, ambient environment and maintenance practice are comparable.

### Separate requirement from measurement

An engineer should be able to state the acceptance requirement before seeing the measurement. Otherwise thresholds tend to move after results are known. Preserve the original requirement, report any exception and obtain authorized approval for changes.

A professional worksheet for **life-cycle cost and staged improvement** should preserve the original event definition and the raw denominator used in the calculation. Build a simple diagram that traces the studied input to a measured output. Label its arrows as measured relationships, physical assumptions or hypothetical causal mechanisms. This keeps the numerical calculation from silently becoming proof of a mechanism that has not been investigated.

## 2. Governing relation and derivation checks

**Primary relation:** `Present value of a cost at year t: PV=C_t/(1+r)^t, with discount rate r consistently defined.`

The relation should first be read in words and translated into a dimensional statement. Identify which quantities are probabilities, time or cycle measures, rates, costs, loads, engineering scores or empirical indicators. If an input is a probability, its feasible interval is from zero to one; if it is an event intensity, it must be nonnegative and accompanied by a unit such as failures per operating hour. The output should be interpreted at the same stated boundary and over the same mission or reporting period as its inputs.

**Reasoning sequence.** (i) Define the asset and the function; (ii) write all inputs and their units; (iii) choose the simplest physically defensible model; (iv) perform the computation using an independent check; (v) compare the result with limiting cases; (vi) state uncertainty and model boundaries before recommending maintenance. For example, the limit of a no-failure event probability as an assumed event rate approaches zero should be consistent with ordinary experience. A result outside its physically possible range suggests either an arithmetic fault, incompatible units or a model used outside its assumptions.

**Worked engineering example.** An upgrade costs 20,000 now and avoids 5,000 annual operating cost for five years. At discount rate 8%, discounted savings are about 19,963, slightly below the investment before other benefits.

After evaluating the arithmetic, report what the result means and—equally important—what it does not mean. Distinguish a hypothetical prediction from a measured population statistic. If a numerical example uses a notional fleet or synthetic data, it must not appear in an operator's work package as a measured site result. For any policy comparison, repeat the calculation using at least two plausible ranges for its most uncertain input and report whether the choice changes.

### Keep the operational objective in view

A metric is useful when it changes a decision that helps deliver service. Additional data collection should therefore answer a concrete question: whether to inspect, redesign, change stocking policy, add monitoring or accept an explicitly bounded residual risk.

## 3. Where the model can fail

Future downtime cost is uncertain and may be nonlinear; a tiny expected advantage is not robust when inputs are poorly measured.

An important diagnostic practice is to seek evidence against the simplest explanation. A repair which temporarily restores output can disguise an uncorrected design, installation or operating error. If the apparent rate improves after a maintenance change, normalize against exposure and examine whether production load, weather, equipment population or reporting conventions changed in the same period. Correlation between a signal and a failure does not establish that intervening on the signal will prevent the failure.

The operational consequence of a bad assumption depends on the equipment. For an ordinary production asset it may mean excess inventory or a costly breakdown. For a safety-critical plant it can mean loss of containment, personnel exposure, service failure or violation of required inspection obligations. Use the teaching result only for understanding; site-specific decisions need competent hazard review, current standards, supplier instructions, physical verification and appropriate approval.

### Plan a falsification test

A good explanation can be disproved. State an observation that would contradict the proposed failure mechanism, and arrange measurements so another engineer could reach an independent conclusion rather than merely agreeing with the initial diagnosis.

## 4. Engineering investigation: from model to evidence

**Field prompt.** Build a base/low/high scenario table for a bearing-monitoring program and specify pilot exit criteria.

Connect this task to the unit study: Plan an accelerated bearing test and an acceptance maintenance rehearsal for a new industrial manipulator, including safe energy isolation and measurement uncertainty. The expected notebook output is concrete: Deliver a requirement-to-evidence matrix, test protocol, repair task analysis, change-control log and unresolved safety questions. Include a sketch, a table of unknowns and an explicit statement of what observation would reverse the initial hypothesis. A useful investigation records the condition before repair, retains component photographs when safe, notes firmware and calibration versions where relevant, and documents any temporary bypass. Explain how the conclusion would be independently reproduced by another analyst.

**Proposed procedure.** First obtain permission and confirm the relevant safe isolation and operating boundaries; never open energized or pressurized equipment for a classroom exercise. Second use a published sampling interval or an explicit study protocol. Third capture raw data with units, timestamps and event codes before cleaning or filtering them. Fourth run a simple hand calculation and cross-check it with a separate implementation. Fifth evaluate sensitivity to one omitted mechanism, one measurement bias and one uncertain input. Sixth record the proposed action, owner, estimated restoration impact and a verification measure that will be checked after implementation.

A reliable result can be modest. It may show that two alternatives cannot yet be distinguished, that a missing event time prevents statistical estimation or that extra inspection has poor coverage. Reporting these limitations is preferable to manufacturing precision. For plant-level application, specify which person may authorize a shutdown, restart or alteration of protection logic; a textbook exercise never supplies that authorization.

## 5. Exercises and instructor checkpoints

1. **Definitions.** Define the physical or functional event involved in **life-cycle cost and staged improvement**. Give its observable boundary and one alternative definition that would change the counted population.
2. **Quantification.** Use the relation `Present value of a cost at year t: PV=C_t/(1+r)^t, with discount rate r consistently defined.` with a consistent assumed dataset of your own. Show all units and at least one limiting-case check.
3. **Sensitivity.** Change the most uncertain nonzero input by ±20% where physically meaningful. Compare the output and decide whether the maintenance choice is robust.
4. **Counterexample.** Explain precisely why the following limitation matters: Future downtime cost is uncertain and may be nonlinear; a tiny expected advantage is not robust when inputs are poorly measured.
5. **Application.** Build a base/low/high scenario table for a bearing-monitoring program and specify pilot exit criteria. Supply an evidence table with at least three observations and mark each entry as measured, supplied by a source, or synthetic.

**Self-check guidance.** A correct response identifies the function, model, assumptions, arithmetic, consequence and plausible falsification. The numeric exercise should be reproducible from the student's displayed inputs. The sensitivity response should not silently vary an independent parameter if two inputs are physically coupled. The field task should end with an evidence request or a testable action rather than a generic recommendation to “do maintenance.”

## 6. Connections to the wider curriculum

This topic interacts with earlier units through lifetime probability, state restoration, operating mechanisms and cost. When proposing a spare or a maintenance interval, ask how it changes both the frequency of failures and the length of lost service. When proposing a sensor, ask how often it produces a useful warning and how the organization responds. An effective recommendation uses the smallest set of credible assumptions needed for the stated decision and explains the circumstances under which its simplified formula would stop being useful.

**Source-reading exercise.** Compare the language of your model with the NIST reliability handbook or the NASA reliability-centered maintenance material listed in the references. Do not reproduce external texts; use the primary source to check the meaning of the statistical term or maintenance method, then describe the limitation in your own words.
